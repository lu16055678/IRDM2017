        <p>The Chair welcomed the committee and noted apologies for absence from Jill Saunders (Departmental Administration Manager), JJ Giwa (Facilities and Operations Manager) and Juan Zhou (Year 1 PhD Rep). </p> 
        <p><b>2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>NOTIFICATION OF ANY OTHER BUSINESS</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>The Student Reps raised the examination timetable to be discussed under AOB. </p> 
        <p><b>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APPROVAL OF MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING ON 20<sup>th</sup> November 2013.</b> </p> 
        <p>The minutes were approved as an accurate record of the meeting.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p><b>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING:</b> </p> 
        <p><b>4.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Student run helpdesk (Graham Roberts)</b> </p> 
        <p>The Chair reported that the department intends to enhance the roles of Teaching Assistants (TAs), to improve their effectiveness.&nbsp; In addition, a new role of Student Mentor will be introduced, where students on taught programs (undergraduate and MSc) will run a helpdesk in one of the labs and be able to give quick responses to student queries. This will be a paid position of probably 2 hours per day for a small group of mentors. &nbsp;There will be a recruitment and training process for all TA and mentoring posts.&nbsp; Also the department will be a recruiting a Teaching Labs Manager. This role will organize and run the teaching labs. </p> 
        <p><b>4.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Drinking water in the lift lobby area (JJ Giwa)</b> </p> 
        <h1></h1> 
        <p>The Chair reported that Estates is still investigating the possibility of having water coolers in the lift lobby areas.&nbsp; JJ Giwa has been chasing Estates for a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main issue is that the building’s plumbing is not in the correct area to have the machines plumbed in.&nbsp; In addition there are health and safety and maintenance concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>It was agreed that this item would continue to be an item on the agenda. </p> 
        <p><b>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion about MSc CS/FC option module pre-requisites (Kevin Bryson)</b> </p> 
        <p>Kevin Bryson reported he had met with the student reps after the last meeting.&nbsp; It was agreed that the artificial intelligence module would not be considered as a standard option due to the pre-requisites. It had transpired that no students had taken the artificial intelligence module as an option.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p><b>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space and facilities in any potential new CS building (Graham Roberts)<br> </b>The Chair reported that proposed new Computer Science building may be available by the end of 2015. The Provost is aware of the department’s issues with space.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>The Chair again invited comments from students on the facilities they would like, including ideas on lay out, access, teaching and social spaces – this was a great opportunity to secure an inspiring new space. </p> 
        <p><br> ACTION: Students to send ideas to JJ Giwa, Graham Roberts and Jill Saunders. </p> 
        <p><b>Agenda Items</b> </p> 
        <p><b>5</b>.<b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teaching Matters</b> </p> 
        <p><b>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resubmission on moodle (Michael Boon)</b> </p> 
        <p>Michael Boon reported that on some modules it is not possible to replace a piece of coursework on Moodle with an updated version before the submission deadline.&nbsp; It appeared currently to be the preference of the individual tutor when setting up Moodle.&nbsp; The Chair advised that this may have been caused by a change in the default settings and that not all tutors were aware that the settings needed to be changed to allow students numerous submissions up to the deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was agreed that this would be added to the Teaching Committee agenda. </p> 
        <p>Manoj Vaseekharan reported that a receipt was not always given when submitting a piece of coursework in Moodle.&nbsp; The Chair advised this was due to the part of Moodle used for coursework submission and it could not be amended. </p> 
        <p><b>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late return of marked coursework (Manoj Vaseekharan / Necati Munir)</b> </p> 
        <p>Manoj Vaseekharan reported that in certain instances students were receiving coursework feedback up to 6 weeks after submission.&nbsp; The Chair acknowledged that this was an issue in the department and UCL and had been discussed at the last Teaching Committee meeting.&nbsp; The department is aiming to enforce the 4 week turnaround on coursework.&nbsp; To support this it was suggested that the Student Reps could report back on coursework not meeting this deadline.&nbsp; This information would then be passed to the Head of Department to speak with the relevant tutor. </p> 
        <p>Student reps suggested that coursework could be returned in the revision sessions or a final deadline was set each academic year by which all coursework must be returned to students.&nbsp; This deadline would be problematic given that some coursework is not due until late in term 2. </p> 
        <p>The issue is a top priority for UCL. </p> 
        <p><b>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removal of COMP1001 Computer Architecture as core module (Manoj Vaseekharan / Necati &nbsp;Munir)</b> </p> 
        <p>Manoj Vaseekharan reported that the Computer Architecture module was very good and students were disappointed and concerned that it would not be offered in future to 1<sup>st</sup> year students with the move to the IEP. </p> 
        <p>The Chair advised that the decision had been made and could not be changed.&nbsp; Someof the material from the module would remain and be available to students in other forms.&nbsp; The workload on the IEP should be the same as for current 1<sup>st</sup> year students. </p> 
        <p><b>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to past masters projects for MEng students (Richard Everett)</b> </p> 
        <p>Richard Everett reported that he had been unable to access past masters projects and had been informed in the administration office that they were not available to MEng students.&nbsp; The Chair advised that this was not the case and Victoria had given 2012/13 projects to the department office for students to access. </p> 
        <p><b>5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email communication with MSc FC students (David Lonsdale)</b> </p> 
        <p>David Lonsdale reported that a small number of students were not receiving emails and suggested this maybe a list management issue.&nbsp; Antoaneta Serguieva advised that she sent emails to students via moodle for the relevant module and also using the email lists.&nbsp; The Chair commented that it could be an email client issue and suggested any students experiencing difficulties should access their emails through the web interface.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p><b>5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coursework deadlines (David Lonsdale)</b> </p> 
        <p>David Lonsdale reported that on the MScCS/FC Operating Systems module there had been a delay in coursework being set and when the tutor was asked about it, the students were advised to wait and it would be set.&nbsp; In the end the coursework was cancelled and the students are concerned about the impact on learning and testing of their knowledge before the examinations.&nbsp; Kevin Bryson advised that he was aware of the situation and had agreed with the module lecturer to cancel the coursework and update the weighting of the examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
        <p><b>5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranking of MSc FC students (David Lonsdale)</b> </p> 
        <p>David Lonsdale reported that the students were concerned that an email had been circulated to&nbsp;them with an attached excel spreadsheet that had ranked each student on the programme. Antoaneta Serguieva explained that the email had been forwarded to the students in error with&nbsp;the Excel spreadsheet still attached.&nbsp; Antoaneta had explained the situation to any students who had&nbsp;&nbsp; contacted her directly and agreed to send an email to all students on the programme explaining what had happened. </p> 
        <p>Action: Antoaneta Serguieva to email students on the MSc FC programme. </p> 
        <p><b>5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissatisfaction with compulsory MSc FC modules (David Lonsdale)</b> </p> 
        <p>David Lonsdale reported that there appears to be general dissatisfaction with the compulsory FC&nbsp;modules.&nbsp; The structure of the lectures was not providing an introduction to those students who&nbsp;did not have a financial background and as a result they were finding it overwhelming. </p> 
        <p>Action: Antoaneta Serguieva and David Lonsdale to discuss after the meeting. </p> 
        <p><b>5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Student Survey (NSS) (Nicola Alexander)</b> </p> 
        <p>Nicola Alexander reported that the response rate to the NSS survey has passed the minimum needed but more responses were wanted.&nbsp; An incentive was being provided as encouragement to respond to the survey and increase the response rate.&nbsp; Richard Everett asked if it was possible to know the students who had not yet responded.&nbsp; Nicola advised that this information was not available as she could only see the percent of responses by programme. </p> 
        <p><b>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilities</b> </p> 
        <p><b>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifting of the food ban in the labs (Manoj Vaseekhara/Necati Munir/Richard Everett)</b> </p> 
        <p>The Chair reported that the food ban had been put back in place due to a number of complaints, one of which had escalated.&nbsp; The labs had become shabby with rubbish being left around, bins overflowing and it becoming common place to eat hot and smelly food in the labs.&nbsp; </p> 
        <p>The Student Reps asked for the ban to be lifted as it had been brought in without any warning and for the ban to apply to hot food.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chair responded that the threshold had been reached with regards to food in the labs and as a result the ban would stay in place. </p> 
        <p><b>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Other Business</b> </p> 
        <p>The Chair reported that a draft examination timetable had been circulated by the examinations office to the departments and it is expected that the examination timetable will be released to students by Friday 28<sup>th</sup> March 2014 </p>
