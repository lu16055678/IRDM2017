          Abstract: Abstract: sets of records. In particular, we view a computable query as being ordering function, which orders the records in a set well as the values of each record in the set, computable queries and showing the equivalence of these subclasses ones already defined in the database literature. a computable query with respect to the said equivalence relation: $\delta$ realises exactly one computable query, $\delta$ realises a countably infinite set of computable queries. mappings is the set of all isomorphism-independent computable queries.
