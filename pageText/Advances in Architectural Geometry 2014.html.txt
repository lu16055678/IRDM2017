         Advances in Architectural Geometry 2014
 
         
          
          

          
          

         
 
         UCL Computer Science recently hosted the Fourth Edition of the Advances in Architectural Geometry (AAG) Conference. Running 18th-21st September. 
 
         AAG is a symposium where both theoretical and practical work linked to new geometrical developments is presented. This symposium aims to gather the diverse components of the contemporary architectural tendencies which push the building envelope towards free form and respond to the multiple current design challenges. It involves architects, engineers, mathematicians, software designers and contractors. We aim at connecting researchers from architectural and engineering practices, academia and industry. AAG has become a reference in the professional field and is supported by the direct participation of the most renowned architectural design and engineering offices along with academic laboratories. 
 
         This year's event consisted of two days of presentations of accepted papers, followed by two days of hands-on workshops, allowing participants, teachers, students and professionals to learn and experiment with new technologies and practices reflected in the themes tackled during the symposium. 
 
         We would like to thank our sponsors, conference organisers and helpers, UCL Estates and Hospitalit, Senate House Events Team, our speakers and all delegates.
