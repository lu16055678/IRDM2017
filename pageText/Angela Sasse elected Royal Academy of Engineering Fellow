         Angela Sasse elected Royal Academy of Engineering Fellow
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Angela Sasse, Professor of Human-Centred Security and Head of Information Security Research at UCL Computer Science and Director of the UK Research Institute in Science of Cyber Security (RISCS) is among 50 new Fellows elected to the Royal Academy of Engineering. 
 
         The newly elected Fellows represent the cream of the UK engineering profession, including technologists from world-leading engineering companies and distinguished academics from renowned research institutions.
 
         Professor Dame Ann Dowling DBE FREng FRS, President of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: “The commitment and energy of our Fellows is the lifeblood of our Academy. Our new Fellows join us today as the country’s most innovative and creative minds from both academia and industry. We look forward to working with them, learning from their successes and drawing on their considerable expertise as we continue our work to promote engineering at the heart of society.”
 
         The new Fellows join around 1500 others at the Academy, with new members elected annually to join the Fellowship in recognition of their outstanding contributions to engineering.
