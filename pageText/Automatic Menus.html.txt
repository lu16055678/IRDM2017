          Where possible you should try to organise your pages so they reflect a hierarchy that will seem natural to anyone browsing them. This hierarchy will then be reflected in the automatically generated menus. Fig. 1 shows a small tree of pages. Figs. 2, and 3 show the menus that are automatically generated in the left-hand column as some of these pages are viewed. (The menu in Fig 3 includes some additional entries. These are explained below).

          Note that the sub-pages only appear as the hierarchy is descended. 
 
          Links and short-cuts
 
          The icons for Page B and Page C show that these are not standard pages. 

          	Page B is a shortcut; this is a reference to another TYPO3 page which will be shown whenever Page B is selected. 
	Page C is a link to external URL; a reference to a page on another server. Again, this external page will be displayed when the Page C link is clicked. 


          The purpose of including such pages is to have them appear in the menu (presumably their content is relevant) without having to duplicate their content.

          To make a page a shortcut of a link to an external URL you need to edit its page properties.
 
           
         

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Additional Menu Items

        
 
         
         
        
         
          
           
             Fig. 4. Additional menu items viewed in the RTE
            	


          

         

          
           
          The additional entries shown in Fig. 3 are added "by hand" by placing a Regular text element in the LEFT column of the page. These items should be formatted as a bulleted list. They will appear as such in the rich text editor (see Fig. 4) but the bullets will not be shown when the menu is displayed.
