         BBC & UCL Strategic Partnership
 
         
          
          

         
 
         BBC Research & Development have announced a strategic partnership with UCL, to drive innovation, and collaborate on a wide programme of R&D activity. 
 
         Over the next four years, the new partnership between BBC and UCL will focus on an ambitious programme of research work that seeks to advance state-of-the-art communications technologies, Internet research, content production, user experience (UXD) and access services. The outcomes of this research will also be shared with the wider industry. 
 
         Professor Anthony Finkelstein, Dean of UCL Faculty of Engineering, said: "UCL Engineering is committed to delivering research that changes the world. Applying our expertise in cutting-edge computing to create new 'digital experiences' is an excellent example of one way university research can have a real impact on people’s lives. BBC R&D is the ideal partner as they provide both technical excellence and a fantastic platform for exploiting the results of innovation."
