         Best Paper Prize for CS Academic
 
         
          
          Dr Jun Wang

         
 
         Dr Jun Wang, together with colleagues from the University of Glasgow and Birkbeck College, has won the best paper prize at the European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR). ECIR is the main European forum for the presentation of new research results in the field of Information Retrieval. 
 
         The paper addresses the "top-k retrieval problem" in which the aim is to find the optimal set of k documents from a number of relevant documents given the user's query. The authors show that significant improvements can be made over the current state-of-the-art through an alternative treatment which employs techniques originating in Operations Research.
