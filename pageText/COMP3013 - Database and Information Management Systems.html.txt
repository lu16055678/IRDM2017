       COMP3013 - Database and Information Management Systems

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMP3013 (Also taught as: COMPGC06) 
	Year	3
	Prerequisites	Successful completion of years 1 and 2 of the computer science programme.
	Term	2
	Taught By	John Dowell (50%) 
Graham Roberts (50%)
	Aims	This module builds on the introduction to relational databases course in COMP202P. It covers advanced data modelling and database development methodology, the techniques exploited by relational database technologies relating in particular to query processing and transaction management, and post relational database technologies including object oriented databases and web databases. The coursework is an interesting group project lasting the duration of the term and building a web facing database system using very contemporary technologies. 
	Learning Outcomes	Understanding of the theory, methods and technologies of relational databases and their development. Competence with SQL and in building web facing database systems. Understanding of application issues and current trends in database technologies.

          Method of Instruction:

         
 
          
          
         Each week students will attend a 'theory' seminar (1-2 hours, led by JD), a 'lab' lecture (1 hour, given by GR), and a group session in the lab (1 hour). The 'theory' lectures are provided by online video only which students must watch in advance of the weekly seminar.  The 'lab' lecture will teach students how to use the technologies needed for the coursework. Visiting speakers from industry will give some of the seminar sessions.
 
          
        
 
         
         
         
          
         
          Assessment:

         
 
          
          
         The course has the following assessment components:

         	 Written Examination (2.5 hours, 70%);
	Coursework Section (1 piece, 30%).


         To pass this course, students must:

         	Obtain an overall pass mark of 40% for all components combined;
	Obtain a minimum mark of 30% in each component worth ≥ 30% of the module as a whole.
