       COMP3080 - Computer Graphics

       This database contains the 2017-18 versions of syllabuses. These are still being finalised and changes may occur before the start of the session.

       Syllabuses from the 2016-17 session are available here.

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMP3080 (Also taught as: COMPGV10) 
	Year	3
	Prerequisites	Successful completion of year 1 and 2 of the Computer Science programme
	Term	1
	Taught By	Anthony Steed (100%) 
	Aims	To introduce the fundamental concepts of 3D computer graphics and give the students all the knowledge needed for creating an image of a virtual world from first principles. 
	Learning Outcomes	The students will be able to define a virtual world and create images of it. They will know how to write a basic ray tracer, and use a graphics library such as OpenGl (or equivalent).

	Coursework Section (25%).


         To pass this course, students must:

         	Obtain an overall pass mark of 40% for all components combined;
	Obtain a minimum mark of 30% in each component worth ≥ 30% of the module as a whole.
