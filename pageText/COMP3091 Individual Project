        All BSc final year students undertake a 1 credit individual project (module code COMP3091). The project is a substantial piece of work and an important part of your final year. Projects are supervised on a one-to-one basis by your project supervisor (a member of the academic or research staff) via weekly tutorials. 
 
         The deadline for finding a project and a project supervisor is
Friday 7th October 2016

 The provisional deadline for submitting your final project report is
 Noon Tuesday 2nd May 2017
