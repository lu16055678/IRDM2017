       COMP3100 - Computer Science Study Abroad

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMP3100 
	Year	3
	Prerequisites	Successful completion of years 1 and 2 of the Computer Science programme, linguistic competence (where appropriate) and satisfactory completion of the UCL Study Abroad Office preparatory programme 
	Term	1-3
	Taught By	Co-ordinator = Study Abroad Tutor (Jens Krinke) (100%) 
	Aims	The educational aims of the programme follow exactly those of the existing MEng Computer Science, with the additional aims of extending the educational experience of students through:(a) Continuing advanced education in computer science, (b) Experience of education in a different cultural and/or linguistic setting, and (c) Access to high level teaching and research expertise from outside UCL. 
	Learning Outcomes	Students will have studied courses at an appropriate breadth and depth to enable them to progress to Year 4 of the MEng CS (International Programme) whilst at the same time having benefited from the experience of HE in a different linguistic and/or cultural setting.

           Students studying abroad must follow a programme that is to the fullest extent possible agreed in advance with the Study Abroad Tutor. The programme MUST satisfy the following elements. 
          


         	 Be of overall of equivalent depth to that of the UCL 3rd year MSci/MEng Computer Science programme G401
	Be substantially composed of courses in computer science or closely allied disciplines such as electrical engineering and mathematics
	Have a significant engineering orientation (as defined by UK-SPEC), be compliant with the QAA benchmark framework, and meet the requirements of our accrediting bodies (BCS and IET)
	Be of equal workload to that of the UCL 3rd year MSci/MEng that is, using accepted equivalence measures, be of 4 units
	Be formally assessed by the host institution and the results of the assessment independently reported to the Study Abroad Tutor
	Include taught courses/units, that is should not consist solely of project work
	Be formally documented by the student in an up to date written study plan, signed by the Study Abroad Tutor and kept by the Departmental Tutor
