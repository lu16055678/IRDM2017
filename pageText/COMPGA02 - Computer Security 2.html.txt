       COMPGA02 - Computer Security 2

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGA02 (Also taught as COMPM065)
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	Computer Security I or equivalent introduction to security course required.
	Term	2
	Taught By	Emiliano De Cristofaro (50%) and Gianluca Stringhini (50%)
	Aims	Providing an advanced understanding of network and computer security vulnerabilities and countermeasures in real-world systems.
