         	Code	COMPGA09 (Also taught as: COMP3005) 
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	N/A
	Term	1
	Taught By	Steve Hailes (100%)
	Aims	This is a practical course whose primary goal is to develop an understanding of the operation of operating systems, building on and showing the utility of basic material covered in previous courses, including data structures and algorithms, concurrency, and networks. Since most practical operating systems are written in C-based languages, this course will use C. Although an introduction to C will be given, students will be expected to learn it through practice; developing the ability and confidence to learn new languages by oneself is a secondary aim of the module. 
	Learning Outcomes	To be able to: (a) read and understand C well and construct intermediate-level C programs; (b) describe the functions of the major components of an operating system; (c) compare and contrast alternative possible implementations for some of these components; (d) implement a range of components for a practical UNIX-like operating system; (e) analyse the performance of components
