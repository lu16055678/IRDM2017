       COMPGA10 - People and Security

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGA10 (Also taught as: COMPM061) 
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	Knowledge of basic information security principles, and essay-writing skills. Students who are not enrolled in Infosec need to attain permission from the module tutor (AS) to enrol; this requires an interview in person.
	Term	1
	Taught By	Angela Sasse (100%) 
	Aims	Students will be able to specify usability criteria that a security mechanism has to meet to be workable for end-user groups and work contexts; - know the strengths and weaknesses of particular security mechanisms in practice, and hence be able to choose and configure mechanisms for best performance in a given organisational context; and - be able to specify accompanying measures (policies, training, monitoring and ensuring compliance) that a user organisation needs to implement to ensure long-term security in practice. 
	Learning Outcomes	Students will be able to apply their knowledge of human factors to computer security

         Introduction The Human Factor in Security:
 Systems thinking and design
 Usability: Users, tasks and context
 Performance and Workload
 Productivity and performance vs risk and security 
 
 Authentication
 Authentication tasks: enrolment, verification, recovery
 Knowledge-based authentication: Passwords, -phrases, PINs, graphical Authentication
 Token-based authentication
 Biometric authentication: physical and behavioural
 Continuous authentication via devices, sensors, and biometrics
 Payment systems and transaction authentication
 
 Access control
 Different access control models, organisational impact and user workload 
 
         Attacks and attackers (and how to counter them)
 Types of attacks (Guessing, observation, capture and coercion)
 Types of attackers: motivation, resources risk propensity
 Social engineering attacks
 Insider attacks
 
 Identity
 Online identity vs identity in the physical world
 National identity vs socially constructed systems
 Digital footprints, shadows and superidentities
 Identity as currency
 
 Privacy
 Data protection and user perception
 Delivering privacy: Privacy by Design, the PST model
 Surveillance, dataveillance and sousveillance online and in the physical world (CCTV)
 
 Trust
 Model of trust in online interaction
 Game theory: incentivising trustworthy behaviour
 Reputation systems and their application in online systems
 
 Influencing user behaviour
 Security awareness, education and training
 User interface design and influencing techniques
 Values, attitudes, security culture and security behaviour
 Responsibility and communication
