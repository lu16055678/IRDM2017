       COMPGA16 - Malware

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	 Code	COMPGA16 (Also taught as: COMPM066)
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	Undergraduate courses in logic and discrete mathematics, assembly, and imperative programming.
	Term	1
	Taught By	David Clark (Module Leader), Jens Krinke, Earl Barr, Paul Gill, Gianluca Stringhini, Hector Menendez, Sukriti Bhattacharya.
	Aims	To provide students with (1) Specialist understanding of the issues and techniques in malware detection and classification (2) Broad understanding of the human, social, economic and historical context inwhich malware exists and is deployed.
	Learning Outcomes	Successful completion of this course will provide students with a specialist understanding of the nature of malware, its capabilities, and how it is combatted through detection and classification. Students will understand what are the underlying scientific and logical limitations on society’s ability to combat malware. Furthermore, students should have a an appreciation and broad understanding of the social, economic, and historical context in which malware occurs.
