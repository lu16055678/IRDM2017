       COMPGA18 - Cryptanalysis

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGA18 (Also taught as COMPM068)
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	Introduction to Cryptography COMPGA03
	Term	2
	Taught By	Nicolas Courtois and Christophe Petit
	Aims	Study of major topics in cryptanalysis. Showing a variety of ways to break, fix/repair and to measure/evaluate the security of cryptographic primitives. Understanding the maths, the security design principles, the internal structure and important properties of major cryptosystems. Study of major computational hard problems in cryptography (symmetric and public key). Step by step analysis of mathematical/algebraic/statistical attacks, methods and algorithms in cryptanalysis. 

	Learning Outcomes	Knowledge and understanding of how current cryptographic security technologies are built with individual components and their interaction, how they are (sometimes) defeated and how they can be designed or enhanced to be more robust. Understanding security goals, attacks and defences and other requirements in cryptographic systems.Understanding different types of attacks (e.g. key recovery vs. decryption). Learning how to evaluate the practical feasibility of attacks in terms of time, memory, pre-computation, data and the protocol / context in which they can be executed. 
Understanding the role of keyed operations, non-linearity, randomness, one-wayness, diffusion, side-channel vulnerabilities, permutations, security reductions, etc in the design of cryptographic protections. Discovering with software of key properties which are relevant to their security. Learning how to use standard crypto libraries, computer algebra software and software cryptanalysis tools. Learning how cryptosystems fail (theory/practice).

           Method of Instruction

         
 
          
          
         Tutor-led class sessions, problem-solving, student projects with programming, participation in code-breaking competitions, private study. Concepts will be illustrated by practical computations with software and computer explorations.  
 
         Students will execute individual small projects in which they will focus on study/analysis/discovery/implementation of particular cryptanalytic attacks.
 
          
        
 
         
         
         
          
         
          Assessment

         
 
          
          
         There is NO written examination. The module has the following assessments: 

         	Coursework 1 (50%): Individual Exploratory Programming Project
	Coursework 2 (50%): Participation in a Code Breaking Competition (Jan-May 2017)


         The competition will be similar yet different than last years competition: www.benthamsgaze.org/2015/06/24/ucl-code-breaking-competition/ 
 
         In code breaking competitions students will be assessed on  
 
         1) their engagement, participation, team spirit, intellectual attitude and curiosity, 
2) mastery of underlying mathematical/algorithmic concepts and operational tools and techniques, and 
3) scientific and practical achievements, exploration visualisation and exploitation of data and results.  
 
         To pass this module, students must: 

         	Complete both the Individual Exploratory Programming Project and Participation in a Code Breaking Competition; and
	Obtain a pass mark of 50% for the module overall
