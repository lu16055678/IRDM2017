       COMPGC99 - Individual Project

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGC99 
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	Successful completion of core and option courses within the MSc Computer Science
	Term	2-3
	Taught By	Various academic staff supervisors (Co-ordinated by Graham Roberts-100%) 
	Aims	To give students experience of undertaking and completing a large piece of work, applying techniques learned throughout the programme, including the technical skills of analysis, design and implementation. 
	Learning Outcomes	To be able to: work individually developing a major project, plan and coordinate development activities, make realistic work commitments, present the work done effectively to a deadline.

         Overview
There is no set syllabus: students identify their chosen project area and are allocated a supervisor who is a member of academic staff. The supervisor provides support and guidance. The project runs from immediately after the examination period (May) with the students responsible for organising themselves and their work, with advice from their supervisor. Student are expected to meet with their supervisor on a regular basis, as agreed with the supervisor. A typical project will comprise approximately 4 weeks of background reading, analysis and design, followed by 4 weeks of implementation and finally 4 weeks to write an in-depth dissertation.
Exceptionally a student may undertake a project that does not require programming skills. However a student undertaking such a project would be required to demonstrate an exceptionally high level of skill in the areas of analysis synthesis critical assessment and design. It is not a soft option and students are advised that such a project is typically much harder than a 'programming' project.Some projects are done in conjunction with other departments of the College. Others are done in conjunction with external organisations although supervision is always provided within the department. 
 
         Project Report
The main report documents the results of the project. The deadline for submission is normally around the end of the first week of September. The project has a weighting equivalent to 2 course units so represents one third of the MSc programme.
The final report is normally recommended to be not more than 45 pages long although appendices are permitted. The total length of report and appendices must not exceed 120 A4 pages.
