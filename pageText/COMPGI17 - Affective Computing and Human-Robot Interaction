       COMPGI17 - Affective Computing and Human-Robot Interaction

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	 COMPGI17 (Also taught as: COMPM082) 
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	Fundamentals of calculus, probability, statistics or have taken either COMPGI01 (Supervised Learning) or COMPGI20 (Introduction to Supervised Learning) in term 1. (GI02 Unsupervised Learning is a plus). 
	Term	2
	Taught By	Nadia Berthouze (100%) 
	Aims	The module targets students who have no previous knowledge in cognitive science and emotion theory and therefore the aim of Part 1 of the module is to give a basic introduction to the theory of emotion from psychology and neuroscience viewpoints and to understand its importance in human decision and communication processes. Part 2 will concentrate on the application of machine learning techniques to emotion recognition by looking at current applications in entertainment, education, and health. Part 3 will focus on the challenges in designing robots that are capable of socially interacting with humans. Examples of current applications in entertainment, education, health, therapy, rehabilitation, service robotics, rescue robots will be used to identify problems and discuss machine learning solutions for the topics taught in Parts 2 and 3. 
	Learning Outcomes	To have a basic knowledge of emotion models and of how technology (e.g., robot) can be endowed with the ability to affectively and socially interact with its user. To understand the challenges that affective computing and HRI pose to the machine learning field and identify the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning techniques to address those issues. To understand how traditional HCI methods need to be modified to be applied to the HRI field.
