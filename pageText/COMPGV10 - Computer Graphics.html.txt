       COMPGV10 - Computer Graphics

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGV10 (Also taught as: COMP3080 Computer Graphics) 
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	
	Term	1
	Taught By	Anthony Steed (100%) 
	Aims	To introduce the fundamental concepts of 3D computer graphics and give the students all the knowledge needed for creating an image of a virtual world from first principles. 
	Learning Outcomes	The students will be able to define a virtual world and create images of it. They will know how to write a basic ray tracer, and use a graphics library such as OpenGl (or equivalent).
