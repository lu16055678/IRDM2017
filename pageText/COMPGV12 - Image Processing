       COMPGV12 - Image Processing

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGV12 (Also taught as: COMP3072 Image Processing) 
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	There are no particular pre-requisites for this course over and above the normal entrance requirements for the MSc CGVI programme
	Term	1
	Taught By	Lourdes Agapito (100%) 
	Aims	The first half of this course introduces the digital image, describes the main characteristics of monochrome digital images, how they are represented and how they differ from graphics objects. It covers basic algorithms for image manipulation, characterisation, segmentation and feature extraction in direct space. The second half of the course proceeds to a more formal treatment of image filtering with some indication of the role and implications of Fourier space, and more advanced characterisation and feature detection techniques such as edge and corner detection, together with multiresolution methods, treatment of colour images and template matching techniques. The course provides the orportunity for students to explore a range of practical techniques, by developing their own simple processing functions either in a language such as Java and/or by using library facilities and tools such as MatLab or IDL. NOTE. This is a core course for the MSc CGVI programme, and is an option course for the MRes VEIV. 
	Learning Outcomes	To understand (i.e., be able to describe, analyse and reason about) how digital images are represented, manipulated, encoded and processed, with emphasis on algorithm design, implementation and performance evaluation.
