       COMPGX99 - Robotics and Computation Dissertation

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPGX99
	Year	MSc
	Prerequisites	None
	Taught By	Danail Stoyanov and Vijay Pawar 
	Aims	The aim of this module will be for students to focus on a specific problem in robotics and autonomous systems and go through the cycle of formulating a solution based on existing knowledge in the field as well as devising novel solutions to application specific tasks. The student will be expected to implement a working prototype of their system or algorithm design either in a practical implementation or within a simulation framework. The student will learn to write a thesis summarizing their project and to deliver presentations about their work as well as a demo as  a proof of concept of their work. 
	Learning Outcomes	Students successfully completing the module should understand:
1. Project design. specification and planning
2. Focus on a specific aspect of robotic technologies either in theory, methodology or application
3. Thesis writing and reporting

              Each project is unique and has its own natural length which will be discussed with the project supervisor to ensure that all relevant material is included. Typically the project will include a literature reviews chapter, a methods chapter detailing the techniques and developments implemented or performed by the student, an experimental chapter reporting the validation and experimentation achieved through the project and a discussion and conclusions chapter. This structure is only a guide and projects will be able to deviate from it as advised by the academic supervisor at UCL. The project code will also need to be submitted together with the project thesis. For mechatronically orientated projects equivalent material to code would include design files and plans. These will be uploaded in Moodle packaged as a bundle consisting of a pdf of the project thesis, the source code/design files and a documentation file (up to 5 pages maximum length) describing how to use or run the materials.
             
             

              Some example project categories are:
             
             

              • Tele-manipulation and the integration of haptic interfaces
             
             

              • Robotic assisted imaging and sensing 
             
             

              • Environment mapping for robot navigation 
             
             

              • Visual-servoing and robotic control systems 
             
             

              • Learning and intelligent robotic actions 
             
             

              • Applied robotics — eg. medical, inspection, manufacturing
             
            
           
          
         
         	
	
	

 
          
        
 
         
         
         
          
         
          Method of Instruction:

         
 
          
          
         The module will consist of independent study, review of the literature, project design and specification, project development through software or hardware work and finally reporting through a thorough thesis. The work will be supervised by at least one of the MRes programme tutors and will be monitored by the programme director.
