       COMPGZ01 - Networked Systems

       This database contains the 2017-18 versions of syllabuses. These are still being finalised and changes may occur before the start of the session.

         	Code	COMPGZ01 (Also taught as: COMP3035) 
	Year	3
	Prerequisites	
	Term	1
	Taught By	Mark Handley (100%)
	Aims	To offer a rigorous introduction to the problems that arise when networking computer systems, and algorithms and systems design that solve these problems. The architectural principles and protocols that underlie the internet will be explained in detail. Topics to be taught will include the physical layer, widely used link layers (wired and wireless), MAC protocols, internetworking, intra-domain routing, reliable transport, congestion control, wide-area (policy) routing, naming, network security, the end-to-end principle, and network applications. 
	Learning Outcomes	Understanding the nuances interactions between a network's distributed entities is a vital skill, without which one cannot truly be said to understand networking. To help students develop this skill, 3035/GZ01 incorporates significant programming courseworks in Python and Java, in which students build working implementations of network protocols.
