       COMPM012 - Programming & Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning

       This database contains 2015-16 versions of the syllabuses. For current versions please see here.

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPM012 (Also taught as: COMPGI07) 
	Year	4
	Prerequisites	Part A: Proficiency in at least one high-level programming language such as C, C++, Pascal or Java etc as the course does not teach programming skills from scratch. Prior programming expertise is needed so that the new languages can be introduced quickly. Part B: although this course is not mathematically rigorous students should be at home in multivariate calculus and linear algebra. 
	Term	1
	Taught By	Mark Herbster (Part A) (50%) 
Massi Pontil (Part B) (50%) 
	Aims	The aims of Part A are: to provide a practical knowledge and understanding of the programming environments of Matlab and Mathematica. Knowledge of and proficiency in these languages/packages form an essential component of COMPM055 (Supervised Learning). The aim of Part B is to introduce the students to those elements of linear algebra which play an important role in machine learning and data analysis. 
	Learning Outcomes	Part A - Programming Issues: To be able to program in Matlab and Mathematica and to recognize their strengths and weaknesses versus conventional programming languages. Part B - To become confident with vector/matrix computations and basic concepts of linear algebra which are important for the development of machine learning techniques.
