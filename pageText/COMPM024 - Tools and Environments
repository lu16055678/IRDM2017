       COMPM024 - Tools and Environments

       This database contains the 2017-18 versions of syllabuses. These are still being finalised and changes may occur before the start of the session.

       Syllabuses from the 2016-17 session are available here.

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPM024 (Also taught as: COMPGS04) 
	Year	4
	Prerequisites	Successful completion of Years 1 and 2 of the Computer Science undergraduate programme.
	Term	1
	Taught By	Jens Krinke (100%) 
 
	Aims	The course will train students in the principles and application of software tools and environments. The course will cover the fundamental practices that we would expect from any software professional we would want to hire. The course is based on our decades of experience on real projects, including the latest thinking on software process. For most students, it will introduce a lot of new material. 
	Learning Outcomes	On completion of the course unit, the successful student should have a good knowledge and understanding of the nature and variety of software tools and environments that are available for achieving software engineering tasks. The successful student should also be able to select appropriate tools and environments for the task at hand and to apply the tools and environments to achieve the task.
