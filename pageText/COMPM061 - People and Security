         	Code	COMPM061 (Also taught as: COMPGA10) 
	Year	4
	Prerequisites	None
	Term	1
	Taught By	Angela Sasse (100%) 
	Aims	Sudents will be able to specify usability criteria that a security mechanism has to meet to be workable for end-user groups and work contexts; - know the strengths and weaknesses of particular security mechanisms in practice, and hence be able to chose and configure mechanisms for best performance in a given organisational context; and - be able to specify accompanying measures (policies, training, monitoring and ensuring compliance) that a user organisation needs to implement to ensure long-term security in practice. 
	Learning Outcomes	Students will be able to apply their knowledge of human factors to computer security
