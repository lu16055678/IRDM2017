       COMPM085 - Computational Photography and Capture

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPM085 (Also taught as: COMPGV15) 
	Year	4
	Prerequisites	Completion of years 1 and 2 of the BSc/ BEng/ MEng Computer Science or CS with EE Programme plus A-Level maths and basic knowledge of Matlab

	Term	2
	Taught By	Tim Weyrich (50%) 
Gabriel Brostow (50%) 
	Aims	The module is designed to be self-contained, introducing the theoretical and practical aspects of modern photography and capture algorithms to students with only limited mathematical background. The two primary aims are i) to introduce universal models of colour, computer-controlled cameras, lighting and shape capture, and ii) to motivate students to choose among the topics presented for either continuing study (for those considering MSc’s and PhD’s) or future careers in the fields of advanced imaging. 
	Learning Outcomes	Students will develop in-depth knowledge and understanding of the main Computational Photography topics as listed in the attached outline syllabus.
