       COMPM091 - Individual Project

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         	Code	COMPM091 
	Year	4
	Prerequisites	Successful completion of years 1, 2 and 3 of the Computer Science undergraduate programme of study
	Term	1 & 2
	Taught By	Various academic staff supervisors (Co-ordinator = Graham Roberts (100%) 
	Aims	To give students experience of undertaking and completing a large piece of work, applying techniques learned throughout the programme, including the technical skills of analysis, design and implementation. The work should incorporate advanced ideas and methodologies derived from 3rd and 4th year courses 
	Learning Outcomes	To be able to: work individually developing a major project, plan and coordinate development activities, make realistic work commitments, present the work done effectively to a deadline.

         Overview
There is no set syllabus: students identify their chosen project area and are allocated a supervisor who is a member of the academic staff, responsible for providing support and guidance. Students are responsible for organising themselves and their work, with advice from their supervisor with whom they should meet on a regular basis, as agreed with the supervisor. The project begins in October and runs in parallel with normal teaching during terms 1 and 2. The submission deadline is at the start of term 3 just prior to the exams. In addition to the April final report a Project Plan must be submitted in mid-November, outlining the project aims and objectives and providing a work plan, and an Interim Report at the end of January, explaining what has been achieved so far and what it is planned to do during the remainder of the project; these documents are prepared with advice from their supervisor. 

Project Goals
An MEng project is expected to have significant challenges and depth. The student is encouraged to do a research-oriented project and it is possible to submit a research style paper in place of a standard project report. 

Project Report
The final report documents the results of the project. The deadline for submission is 12 noon on the Friday of the first week of term 3. The project has a weight on 1 credit so represents one quarter of the student's final year work.
