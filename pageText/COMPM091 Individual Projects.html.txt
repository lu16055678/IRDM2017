        All MEng final year students undertake a 1 credit individual project (module code COMPM091). A project is a substantial piece of work and an important part of your final year. Projects are supervised on a one-to-one basis by your project supervisor (a member of the academic or research staff) via weekly tutorials. 
 
        An MEng project is expected to reflect the additional depth and experience that the extra year of study over the BSc gives you. You should look for a project that is challenging and cutting-edge. Your project is an excellent opportunity to get involved in the department's research activities and many supervisors offer research-oriented project ideas. 
 
         
 
         The deadline for finding a project and a project supervisor is
Friday 7th October 2015

 The provisional deadline for submitting your final project report is
 Noon Monday 2nd May 2017
