         CREST wins £6.65 million EPSRC funding
 
         
          
          

         
 
         CREST, the Centre for Research on Evolution Search and Testing at UCL Engineering, led by Professor Mark Harman, has been awarded a £6.65 million EPSRC grant to research radical software engineering techniques. 
 
         They will develop a radical new technique named Dynamic Adaptive Automated Software Engineering (DAASE). DAASE will develop theory, algorithms, methods, techniques and tools for adaptive software engineering, with the aim of producing systems that self-monitor and evolve to handle dynamically changing development processes and dynamically changing operating environments. It will draw on expertise from the universities of York, Birmingham and Stirling. 
 
         The DAASE grant is one of three EPSRC grants totalling £18 million recently awarded to projects withing the UCL Engineering faculty.
