         CS Book Launch: Digitized
 
         
          
          

         
 
         On Monday 26 March CS celebrated the launch of a new book, Digitized: The Science of Computers and how it shapes our World, by Dr Peter Bentley, Honorary Reader in the Department. Alongside distinguished guests including Prof Peter Kirstein, who gave an introduction to the book, Peter outlined some of the key moments that Digitized highlights as it takes the reader on a journey of discovery through the history of computer science, including initial theoretical conceptions, early pioneers and implications for the future. 
 
         Digitized covers the whole of computer science - from maths to engineering to social sciences and has received warm reviews already, in Wired Magazine and The Guardian. The book will appeal to general readers interested in computers, or working with computers, and also those younger students considering undergraduate computing, computer science, and IT courses. 
 
         Peter was happy to personally sign copies afterwards as friends of CS enjoyed drinks and a chance to talk to the author. We would like to thank Waterstone’s for hosting a great event.
