         CS EngD VEIV Student shortlisted for Entrepreneurs Award
 
         
          
          

         
 
         CS EngD VEIV Student Jozef Doboš has been shortlisted for Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurs Award. The shortlisting is for Jozef's "3D Repo" work, a novel system for version control of 3D engineering models. The work has been supervised by Prof Anthony Steed. 
 
         The Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurs Award "seeks to identify, encourage and reward young engineering researchers working in UK universities, in the broad field involving electro-technology". The Award "seeks to encourage innovation, meaning the emergence of good engineering into the marketplace, rather than just potential good ideas".
