         CS stars at OxHack
 
         
          
          

         
 
         We were delighted that two teams of four UCL Computer Science students joined OxHack 2014. Running during 29th-30th November and hosted by Oxford Entrepreneurs (OE) and Major League Hacking, the event included over 150 participants from universities all over Europe and sponsorship and mentorship from Facebook, Google, Bloomberg, SendGrid, Mendeley and more. 
 
         Sami Start, Paula Lopez Pozuelo, Divya Surendran and Zayed Al-Nehayan worked together to make an alarm clock that switches on Chromecast on your TV and plays personalised content in an alarm format to wake you up. The UI of the alarm was made on Android and triggered the Chromecast receiver application when the alarm was activated. 
 
         Kartik Joshi, Leo Joffe, Eimi Okuno and Danny Ly collaborated to make a remote control for visualising 3D graphics that allows users to navigate using the gyroscopes in their mobile devices communicated over LAN. This also utilised 3rd party APIs to generate some creative 3D graphs displaying economic data. 
 
         The experience was both extremely challenging and enjoyable with both teams completing working versions of their projects in just 24 hours. The ‘Chromecast Alarm Clock’ team were selected as finalists and presented their application to over 150 people at the closing ceremony, including a panel of venture capitalists and angel investors.
