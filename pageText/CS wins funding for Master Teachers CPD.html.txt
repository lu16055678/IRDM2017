         CS wins funding for Master Teachers CPD
 
         
          
          

         
 
         UCL Computer Science has won the funding from Computing at School (CAS) to run a continuing professional development course for ten CAS Master Teachers from September 2014 through to July 2015. 
 
         Our principle objective is to provide our CAS Master Teachers with the subject knowledge they need to teach the new curriculum and the pedagogy of how to teach Computer Science. The course kicked-off on the 16th and 17th September with Algorithms and Programming. Professor Stephen Hailes started the day with a review of some of the research in the department, an overview of what computer science is, how it underpins everything we do and why computing skills are essential for all of us in the modern world. 
 
         The teachers delivered some great "unplugged" activities illustrating algorithmic thinking featuring magic tricks, assistive technologies and a visit from Robbie the Robot. Elementary programming from "unplugged" through to Scratch and Python was taught by Rae Harbird and David White. Above all the event was fun and at the end UCL was presented with the prestigious "5S Superstar award" by Ben Stradling of Milford Junior School. We would like to thank Class 5S."
