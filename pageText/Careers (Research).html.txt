         Although research students are typically affiliated with one research group, they nevertheless have the opportunity to work not only with other groups within the department but other centres of research across UCL and other institutions.  The department regularly hosts seminars and workshops led both by current research staff and those from other departments and our graduate students attend conferences both nationally and internationally.  They are encouraged to become involved in the research projects of the different groups, and to collaborate on papers and posters.  Research students also have an opportunity to take part in the teaching life of the department, and a limited number of demonstrator positions are offered each year.

In addition to strong cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary academic links, the department prides itself on strong collaboration with and support from industry.  Current and recent collaborations with industry include:

         We believe entrepreneurship is an integral part of research.  UCL-CS is a leader in the integration of entrepreneurship in its activities and this has imparted a distinctive flavour to our research and research education. 

Research students and staff have access to courses at UCL’s Department of Management Science and Innovation (MS&I) and the London Business School (LBS) in entrepreneurship, new ventures and business planning alongside MBA students.  Regular networking events are held at which research students and staff can pitch ideas and are matched with MBA students who can then develop business plans. These are facilitated by the Centre for Scientific Enterprise London (CSEL), with which we also have very close links.

Students can also take advantage of the expertise of our resident Entrepreneur, Dan Brown, or of other CSEL-funded schemes for fostering entrepreneurship in research, including the Chevening Technology Enterprise Scholarships that fund research students to develop ideas and business plans after their degrees, and scholarships to fund an extra chapter in theses in which the business implications of a novel technology are explored.
