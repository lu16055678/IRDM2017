           Celebrating Ada Lovelace Day @ UCL

          
 
           
           
          
           
            
             
              
               
              

             

            

           

            
             
            Local schools, eminent guests from industry and our own staff and students came together to celebrate Ada Lovelace Day @ UCL. Recognised internationally, Ada Lovelace Day is a  celebration of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) - taking the name of the first computer programmer - and is aimed at inspiring the next generation of computer scientists.

            	
	


            Sixty school students and their teachers spent the day with us discovering the interdisciplinary nature of Computer Science; hearing from our keynote speaker Lesley Payne, Global Institute of Digital Health Excellence Lead at Bupa; speed networking with our own researchers and students; and participating in a lively panel debate about the future of robotics.

            	
	


            Special thanks to Prof Steve Hailes who gave an excellent talk explaining that Computer Scientists are often rebels with bad habits; and that UCL graduate Mavis Batey contributed to the success of the D-Day campaign during WWII through her code breaking activities.

            	
	


            Thanks also to our guest schools - Gladesmore Community School and UCL Academy - and for their positive feedback:

            	
	


            "A huge thank you for the day you put together, the pupils hugely enjoyed it and more importantly the girls particularly saw Computing as an option for their GCSEs next year."

            	
	


            Finally, thanks to our own contributors to the day:
