         Chirp app uses sounds to share data
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Animal Systems, a spin-off business from University College London (UCL) led by Anthony Steed, has developed a free app called "Chirp". Chirp uses sound from a smart-phone's speaker to trigger transfers of photos, web pages and contacts. The phones receiving the sound then transfer the data via the company's servers. 
 
         Existing systems share data via WiFi or Bluetooth but these require some time and effort to set up "pairing" arrangements between devices. Chirp avoids this and also enables data to be shared with multiple recipients. The sound used has been carefully chosen to enable the app to work in noisy environments such as pubs and busy streets. 
 
         Chirp has been featured on the BBC's technology website.
