         Class of '06 back at UCL
 
         
          
          

         
 
         In June we welcomed our Class of '06 back for a reunion at UCL. Joined by Prof Philip Treleaven and Dr Licia Capra, who both taught our Alumni during their time studying with us, our guests enjoyed a tour of the Department and an exclusive champagne reception on the Wilkins Roof Garden. 
 
         On a warm summers afternoon our Class of '06 shared old photos, reminisced about their time here and caught up with friends. They also heard about the latest news and developments at UCL Computer Science.  
 
         The Department was also deeply grateful to receive a donation from our Class of '06. We will keep Alumni updated with news of how the gift is contributing towards the student experience for our current and future students. 
 
         Our thanks goes to our Class of '06, and in particular Sophia Qureshi, for her efforts in bringing our group together and organising the day. Our Alumni pictured (L-R) are Patrick Sumby, Sophia Qureshi, Chris Fellows, Chandra Choudhury , David Tatarata , Fod Tzellos , Amy Willis, Remal Tailor, Arman Siddiqui. 
 
         Events such as this are a great way to reconnect former students and help our Alumni community grow. Anyone interested in finding out more can contact Steve Marchant.
