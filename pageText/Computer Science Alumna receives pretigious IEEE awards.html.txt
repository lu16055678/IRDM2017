         Computer Science Alumna receives pretigious IEEE awards
 
         
          
          

          
          

         
 
         We were delighted to hear that UCL Computer Science alumna Eman Alashwali has received two prestigious awards from the Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 
 
         The 105th IEEE Region 8 Committee Meeting held at the Grand Union Hotel in Ljubljana in 10th of October 2015 awarded Eman the Clementina Saduwa Award 2015 and the “Outstanding Counsellor for IEEE Student Branch” for her work this year. The Clementina Saduwa Award 2015 is one of the most prestigious awards in IEEE Region 8 (Europe, Middle East, Africa) dedicated for Women in Engineering (WIE). Eman was presented with a Plaque and $1000 prize.
 
         In addition to this, Eman has received a second award “Outstanding Counsellor for IEEE Student Branch” which is given to only six counsellors from the whole of Europe, Middle East and Africa, in recognition of her service as a Counsellor for King Abdulaziz University IEEE Student Branch. Eman receives a plaque and a share of $300 for this award.
 
         Eman received an MSc in Information Security from UCL Computer Science in 2012 - her masters thesis examined the security of RSA public-keys, in particular the factorable RSA keys issue in TLS servers on the Internet - and was supervised by Dr. Nicolas Courtois. Eman is now Lecturer in the Faculty of Computing & IT (FCIT) at King Abdulaziz University (KAU), and prior to that, spent 3 years in various technical positions in IT departments at: Dar Al-Hekma University, Effat Universiyt, and  Dar Al-Fikr schools. 
 
         We pass on our congratulations.
