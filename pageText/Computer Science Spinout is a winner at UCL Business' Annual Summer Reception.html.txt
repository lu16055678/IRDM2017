         Computer Science Spinout is a winner at UCL Business' Annual Summer Reception
 
         
          
          

         
 
         A data science spinout from UCL Computer Science has received the UCLB One-to-Watch award 2016. Co-founded by the Department's Dr Jun Wang, Reader of Information Systems, MediaGamma has built an Audience Decision Engine, where the “Audience” are viewers of online ads.
 
         The Decision Engine uses Machine Learning to provide information to digital ad trading platforms about the expected behaviour of a person potentially about to view that ad. This helps to inform the real-time decision-making process of the bidding algorithm as to whether or not to show a particular ad to a particular person.
 
         The company is the first recipient of Proof of Concept funding from the UCL Technology Fund.
