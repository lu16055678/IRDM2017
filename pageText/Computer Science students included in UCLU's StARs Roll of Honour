         Computer Science students included in UCLU's StARs Roll of Honour
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Two UCL Computer Science Student Academic Representatives (StARs) have been included in UCLU's 2016 Roll Of Honour. 
 
         Angelos Pillos, an MSc Financial Systems Engineering student, and Konstantinos Metallinos, a MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning student, have been awarded the Advanced Stars Certificate.
 
         The StARs scheme is a partnership between UCL and UCLU.  The StARs scheme helps to ensure that every student at UCL is effectively represented in their department, faculty, the University and UCLU.  Through such effective representation students become partners in their education, allowing them to play an active role in shaping their learning.
 
         UCLU's Representation & Campaigns team put together an annual report outlining the StARs achievements and coverage during the course of the year, with an awards ceremony to follow. 
 
         The Department would like to congratulate Angelos and Konstantinos, and thank all Computer Science StARs.
