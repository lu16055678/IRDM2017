         Computer Science winners at UCL Engineering Engagement Awards
 
         
          
          

         
 
         UCL Computer Science staff and students were winners at the 2017 UCL Engineering Engagement Awards. Led by The Provost, the awards  aim to recognise, empower and celebrate the hard work, commitment and passion that staff and students across the Faculty of Engineering put in to share their research, teaching, and learning with children, young people and schools. 
 
         Computer Science winners were recognised for the outstanding contribution they’ve made to engagement and outreach over the past year. 
 
         Hekla Helgadottir won Undergraduate Student of the Year; Susan Lechelt won Postgraduate Student of the Year; Catherine Holloway won an Academic Staff of the Year award; and Rae Harbird won the top award – Outstanding Engager of the Year. Hekla, Catherine, Rae and Susan are photographed above.
 
         The department would like to congratulate our winners. More information about our Schools Outreach activities can be found here.
