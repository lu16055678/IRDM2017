           Programmes of study may be full-time or part-time. The minimum programme length for the degree of PhD is three years of full-time study or five years of part-time study
           

           
Research students are associated with a particular research group, which takes the lead in their postgraduate research training.  Students are typically co-supervised by two members of the same group.  
           

           
A research degree has a less formal structure than a taught graduate degree.  Since there are fewer constraints on a research student’s time and work, we expect students to have the self-discipline and strong motivation needed to work independently.  However, the department also provides a very detailed scheme of supervision and progress monitoring to guide students through their research.  Students meet regularly with their supervisors and students undergo regular formal progress reviews involving written reports and oral vivas in gradual preparation for their final thesis examination.
          

          

          
 
           
         

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Workshops and Seminars

        
 
         
         
        

        
         A programme of workshops and seminars is offered by the department to promote discussion and disseminate experience between research students as well as to develop students’ professional skills.  Additional courses on research skills are also available through the 
         UCL Doctoral School.
