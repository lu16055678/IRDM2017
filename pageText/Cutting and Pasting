        It is often useful to copy/paste material to/from the TYPO3 Rich Text Editor. For example you might want to copy from a MS Word document or from another web page. This is certainly possible, though you may find that some formatting is lost. (In the case of MS-Word this is certainly deliberate!)

        You may experience a problem if you use Firefox since since this restricts copy and paste for security reasons. However, the problem can be fixed;

        	The keyboard shortcuts (<CTRL-C> for copy <CTRL-V> for paste should still work;
	Copy and paste on the right mouse button menu can be made to work. This page explains several ways of doing it. The Firefox extension AllowClipboard Helper seems to work well.
