      I'm a post-doctoral research associate with 
     Dr. Gabriel Brostow at University College London working on EU-FP7 project 
     "Capture-Reconstruct-Play" and 
     "Nature-Smart Cities - Sensing Nature in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park" EPSRC Impact project. 
    
 
    
      I completed my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at University College London under supervision of 
     Prof. Jan Kautz and 
     Dr. Simon Prince in collaboration with 
     Dr. Neill D.F. Campbell. My PhD thesis, titled "Synthesizing and Editing Photo-realistic Visual Objects", explores image synthesis by combining computer graphics techniques with probabilistic generative models of computer vision. During my PhD I did a summer research internship at Creative Technologies Lab of Adobe in Seattle with 
     Dr. Dan B Goldman. 
    
 
    
      Before starting my PhD, I finished 
     MSc in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging at UCL with distinction. My Master Thesis "Intrinsic Images from Color and Depth", supervised by 
     Dr. Gabriel Brostow, has won "BBC Best Project Prize". 
    
 
    
      Previously, I completed my bachelor degree at 
     Tsinghua University with a scholarship from China National Petroleum Corporation.
