 Current research centres mostly in the area of financial computing, with past work in  bioinformatics (methods for predicting local protein structure, repeating motifs, interface regions in multi-subunit complexes) and on  novel methods for global minimisation (chaperone-based techniques for finding nativelike states of heteropolymer energy functions; smoothing transformations for avoiding local minima in neural network training). Pre-2000 work focused on  hardware-realisable stochastic neural networks as part of the UCL/KCL team that developed the pRAM (probabilistic random access memory) chip.
