         Dividers

        
 
         
         
        Several UCL-CS pages use a divider (like the one below) between sections. 
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
          
           
          It is easy to add one of these above or below a content element. Simply select the Appearance tab on the property form for the content element. (This form is launched by clicking the icon next to the content element). Then select Frame After or Frame Before from the drop-down menu under Indentation and Frames.
