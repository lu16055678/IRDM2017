         Dr Fernando Brandão's paper published in Nature Physics 
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Dr Fernando Brandão, Lecturer at UCL Computer Science, in partnership with Dr Micha Horodecki, from the Institute for Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, University of Gdansk, have had a paper published in the journal, Nature Physics. 
 
         Publushed in August's edition, it demonstrates when the correlation between particles in a sample reduces exponentially with distance, the entanglement between one region and the rest of the sample only depends on the area of the boundary between them. 
 
         Dr Brandão says: "We're very excited to have produced this method. It proves something that seemed to be intuitively true, but the reason why it is true has turned out to be quite different from the original intuition. The result also helps us identify cases where there is low entanglement. These are often good candidates for simulation using classical computers not capable of modeling the consequences of quantum phenomena."
