"Hello world."
 
      
 
      	 

 
      I am the Senior Teaching Fellow for Programming and Industry Projects and a member of both the Software Systems Engineering group and Deputy Director for the Advanced Teaching Group at the Department of Computer Science, University College London. We currently have just over 580 programming-centric students in the Department of Computer Science, 420 of which are in my courses on applied and industry-oriented software engineering. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and Member of the British Computing Society. 
 
      I am also the Director for Apps Engineering for all of UCL's faculties, and support UCL Advances with the contracting of 400+ students yearly on client-engaged projects. I am a co-director of UCL's official App Strategy Working Group with Dr Alastair Moore, increasing UCL-CS visibility across all UCL faculties. If other faculties want to contact me about project requirements they can get in touch with me or my assistant, Dr Yun Fu. A role I keep close attention to in the Advanced Teaching Group is on Technology Transfer (primarily to syllabus and learning domains). Companies and research groups are welcome to contact me with regards to new technology platforms and deployment.
 
       I am joint Head of the Students Special Interest Groups (SSIGs) with my counterpart in UCL Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Mr Tim Bodley-Scott. This group of well-formed inter-year and inter-course societies for students is designed to increase engagement with industry and with research groups, at a self-motivated pace.
 
       As of late 2015, I am also the Lead Academic Trainer for CS Teaching Assistants in Problem Based Learning (PBL) classes. There are currently 58 PhDs and RAs on this programme of activities. This covers the PhD and RA population learning how to engage and manage teaching loads in labs, assessment processes and allocation of student/departmental resources, with effective scalability and distribution of teaching in mind.
 
      My academic speciality is in Constructionism and pedagogical learning theories within Computer Science education. My current focus is on software construction best practices in Software Engineering and the application of Computer Science in general education e.g. via current trends in Apps development and prototyping tools. I am examining a number of school-based learning mechanisms for problem based learning, constructionist reinforcement and student-learning techniques from algorithm approaches to larger solution modelling.
