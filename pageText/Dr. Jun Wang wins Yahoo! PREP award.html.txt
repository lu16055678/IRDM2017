         Dr. Jun Wang wins Yahoo! PREP award
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Among other 24 recipients worldwide, Dr. Jun Wang in the Media Futures group at UCL-CS has won the 2014 Yahoo Faculty Research and Engagement Program (FREP) award.  
 
         The award was granted for his proposal on "Long-term Portfolio Optimisation and Game-Theoretic Analysis for Native Ads", an idea he introduced from finance to the display advertising field.   
 
         Native Advertising is a new form of online advertising that blends online content and advertising (ad) seamlessly. Because of such naturally blending, it departs significantly from traditional display and sponsored search ads and provides a natural way of enriching the user’s experience and delivers better returns for brands. 
 
         The goal of this research project is to model the “combinatorial” effect of the native ads and study its impact on incentives, user experiences, revenue optimisation, and market mechanism design.  
 
         The news coverage can be found in Yahoo! here.
