       ENGS102P - Design and Professional Skills

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

         	Code	ENGS102P 
	Year	1
	Level	1 (UCL Credits/ECTS: 0.5/7.5)
	Prerequisites	None
	Term	1 and 2
	Taught By	Sunny Bains, John Aston, Dave Chapman, Rae Harbird 
	Aims	To be successful engineers, our students need to be able to identify and analyse problems, conceive and design potential solutions, liaise with and present to clients, and work with and direct colleagues. They need to do these things efficiently, ethically, professionally, and competently, and, often, they need to do them quickly. Although it is possible to learn these skills ‘by osmosis’, this can take years—even decades—of trial and error. Our goal is to provide the students with tools at the start of their degrees that will make them more effective during their university career and, crucially, enable them to work as competent professionals not just when they graduate, but when they do projects and internships. 
	Learning Outcomes 	Upon completion of this module students should be able to: 

             	 Outline the basic elements of the design cycle and use these to tackle real engineering problems; 
	 Give examples of ethical issues related to engineering and recall tools that can be used to analyze future problems as they arise; 
	 Give examples of how their specific discipline interacts with sustainability and describe their responsibilities as an engineer in this regard; 
	 Describe an engineering problem and its constraints in a concise written or spoken report; 
	 List the basic tools for critical thinking and problem solving and use these to tackle real problems, whether engineering or otherwise; 
	 Identify and describe the utility of important structural features in writing and presentation (such as introductions, conclusions, and topic sentences), use these effectively, and evaluate their use in others’ work; 
	 Analyze the audience for a given communication (report or talk) and determine the appropriate point of view, level of detail, and jargon; 
	 Identify their own strengths and weaknesses as potential team members (in terms of work habits, technical knowledge, and ability to communicate) and develop a plan to address their weaknesses and capitalize on their strengths; 
	 Describe basic concepts in entrepreneurship, and recall the facilities available to them to develop their abilities in this area; 
	 Recall the basic elements of engineering drawing, and identify whether further study in this area is appropriate for them; 
	 Recognize the level of conduct expected of them by the body governing their profession, explain why such codes of conduct are necessary; and recall where they are spelled out in detail.
