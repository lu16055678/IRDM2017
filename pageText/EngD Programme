         Why choose this course?

        
 
         
         
        

        
         The EngD is a four-year graduate programme intended for the UK’s leading researchers who aspire to key technical and/or managerial positions.  
          A standard EngD VEIV programme runs for four years commencing in late September. Students spend blocks of time at UCL and at an industrial partner. In year one there is a compulsory taught element.
