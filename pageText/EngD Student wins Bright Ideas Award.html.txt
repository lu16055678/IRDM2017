         EngD Student wins Bright Ideas Award
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Jozef Dobos, a student on the EngD Programme in Virtual Environments Imaging and Visualisation, has won a UCL Bright Ideas Award for "3D Repro" - an open source version control system for coordinated management of large 3D data over the Internet. 
 
         3D Repro is currently the only cloud-based solution able to support collaborative development and transmission of 3D models and metadata as well as rendering on the scale required by the industry. This system offers significant improvements in the Building Information Modelling (BIM) workflow not possible otherwise. Instead of stakeholders sharing massive files in a costly and time consuming manner, they can simply point their web browsers to a 3D Repo server in order to examine all project stages virtually, even on mobile devices. 
 
         Jozep is supervised by UCL Prof Anthony Steed and Alvise Simondetti of Arup.
