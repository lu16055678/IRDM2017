         FT features Financial Computing Centre
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The Financial Computing Centre at UCL is a collaboration with the London School of Economics, the London Business School and 20 leading financial institutions. The centre's work has been featured in a major article in the Financial Times. 
 
         The article - "School for quants: Inside UCL’s Financial Computing Centre, the planet’s brightest quantitative analysts are now calculating our future" - describes breadth of the centre's work. It includes interviews and comments from the centre's director, Philip Treleaven,  and from several of the current crop of research students and undergraduates.
