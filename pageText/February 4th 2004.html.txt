        	Agenda for the SSCC meeting 4th February 2004
The meeting will be held at 1:00 pm in room 229.

            	Apologies for absence: Toan Hoang, Amir Nabi
	Notification of any other business.
	Approval of minutes of the last meeting (12th November 2003).
	Matters arising from previous minutes.
- Printing: Service is now laser printer only, the print quota has been increased.
- Departmental Strategy for Teaching and Learning is now available on the web.
- Pearson Society has now been re-activated.
- BSc MACS students taking a Maths project. Discussed at teaching committee and agreed to take issue up with Maths.


	Online availability of Z21/4C33 lecture notes. [Avtar Raikmo]
	Spam and irrelevant messages on CS mail lists. [Aingaran Somaskandarajah]
	Request to lecturers to make more use of course mailing lists to inform students of lecture changes and cancellations, and coursework deadlines. [Avtar Raikmo]
	Sample exam papers for new courses and missing past papers on the library web site. [Avtar Raikmo]
	Recording of lectures and making recordings available to students. [Aingaran Somaskandarajah]
	Student access to wireless network. [Aingaran Somaskandarajah]
	Certain clashes in Timetables for CS EE students: E746 Control systems Lecture (Friday @ 2.00pm - 3.00pm, Nina Thornhill (Professor), Gow 002) Clashes with the 3C05 Advanced Software Engineering Lecture (Friday @ 2.00pm - 3.00pm, W Emmerich, 229 Pearson). Approx 4 MSci CS-EE students are affected... the two courses are mandatory for the students and so they are having difficulty. Is it possible to amend the times for these lectures. [Aingaran Somaskandarajah]
	CS Centric Application/Interview/CV training sessions. Many students have been having difficulties in making applications and attending interviews for jobs/internships in the IT/CS Sector. There are current sessions available for all students at the Careers Advise Center but this is a very general thing and has not helped CS students that well. Is there anyway of setting up a CS version. Possibly setup by Chris Clack? [Aingaran Somaskandarajah]
	The guidelines for -- and the implementation of -- the MPhil/PhD Transfer process are woefully inadequate. 
There seems to be a gross imbalance between 
i) what is expected from the student; and 
ii) the efforts made to make these expectations clear.
The rationale behind the transfer process is largely historical, rather than pragmatic; and it comes at a significant cost to the student's time for what is, by definition, a transitionary and intermittent report. [Philip Bonhard]
	Radiators in the PhD offices (specifically for rooms 116 + 212).  They cannot be regulated and thus generate too much heat, making it uncomfortable to work in the office. [Philip Bonhard]
	Are nightly reboots of the college machines necessary?  This makes it necessary to run programs that have to run over night on private machines. [Philip Bonhard]
	What is happening about the water cooler?  Will there at least be a filter at some point? Why is it taking so long (2 months by now) to be resolved? [Philip Bonhard]
	Any Other Business
