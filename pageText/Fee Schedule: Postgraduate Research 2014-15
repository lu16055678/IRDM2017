        Fee Schedule: Postgraduate Research 2014-15
 
        	  All fees quoted are for new students only in the session 2014-15 and relate to the whole session. Fees for subsequent years are subject to increase and this is implicit in accepting the offer of a place at UCL. All students should expect their fees to rise by approximately 3-5% per year. See further information about this here.
 
	 All continuing students who began their programme of study before 2014-15 will continue to pay fees in their existing fee structure, incurring just the inflationary increase each year.
 
	 Fees for some intercollegiate programmes are charged by the collaborating institution. Where this is the case, the institution's fee schedule should give the appropriate fee.

        	 NON RESIDENTIAL STUDENTS 
	 A deduction of £1,500 from full-time students' fees and £750 from part-time students' fees has been agreed by the Graduate School. This applies to both UK/EU and Overseas students.
 

 
        	   	   	   

 
        	 STUDY LEAVE 
	 Research Degree 	 Fees will be charged at half the full-time or part-time UK/EU fee depending on a student's registration status. 
	 MRes 	 If you are taking Study Leave as part of your MRes, please contact the Student Fees Office to see if a reduced rate applies. 

 
        	   	   	   

 
        	 KEY 
	 * Research programmes at UCL may be subject to an Additional Fee Element (AFE). The AFE is levied to cover additional costs related to consumables, equipment and materials etc. which are not included in the composite tuition fee (i.e. the fee listed in the fees table) and is, therefore, applied to a minority of programmes. As each PhD programme is unique in its nature, the AFE is calculated on a student by student basis and is determined by the supervisor. The AFE is banded into four fixed amounts: £1,000, £2,500, £5,000 and £10,000, with one further band for variable sums over £10,000. Please contact your supervisor directly for advice on whether or not your programme will incur an AFE. Please note that you will be informed of any AFE you will be required to pay in the offer letter. (NB At some UK institutions the AFE may be referred to as “bench fees”.) 
	 *1 Higher rates of £TBC (full-time) and TBC (part-time) are also applicable to some students. Please contact the Department for further details. 
	 *2 Prices available on request from the Department 
	 + Programme available on a Full-Time and Modular basis.
 
	 ++ Programme available on a Modular basis only.
