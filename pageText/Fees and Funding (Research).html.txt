         Scholarships and Studentships

        
 
         
         
        

        
         We have funding available to support excellent students with support for fees and/or living costs. In order to be considered for this funding, candidates should ensure that they submit their application by the
          deadlines advertised. 
         
 
         University College London also has a number of funding opportunities for both home/EU and overseas students, which are extremely competitive. 
 
         For information about these scholarships and others available to potential students please see UCL’s scholarships and funding website. 
 
          
 
         The department also recruits to project studentships, which have deadlines throughout the year.  Applications for these will be evaluated and a decision made as the recruitment deadline necessitates. Such studentships will be on the Vacancies page. Please ensure that you submit a complete application by the deadline specified on the project advert.
