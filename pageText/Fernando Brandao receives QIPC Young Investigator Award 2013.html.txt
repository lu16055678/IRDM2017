         Fernando Brandao receives QIPC Young Investigator Award 2013
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Fernando Brandao, lecturer at UCL Computer Science, has been awarded the 2013 European Quantum Information Young Investigator Award for his work on quantum information science. The award recognizes outstanding accomplishments in quantum information science (both theoretical and experimental) by researchers less than 35 years old. 
 
         According to the prize announcement, the award was given to Dr. Brandao “for his highly appraised achievements in entanglement theory, quantum complexity theory, and quantum many-body physics, which combine dazzling mathematical ability and impressive physical insight”. The prize of 4000 euros has been given to Dr. Brandao at the QIPC (Quantum Information Processing and Communication) conference on 5 July, in Florence. This year’s prize was jointly given to Dr. Brandao and to Prof. Patrick Windpassinger, from Mainz University in Germany. 
 
         Dr. Brandao has recently joined the department of computer science at University College London. Before it, he has worked at ETH as a senior researcher, at Universidade Federal of Minas Gerais (Brazil) as assistant professor, and at Imperial College London as a postdoctoral researcher. He obtained his PhD from Imperial College London in 2008.
