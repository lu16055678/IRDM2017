         List of First Year Student Tutors for 2013-14
 
         Each student has a personal tutor, who is a member of the academic staff. That person will remain your tutor throughout the time you are an undergraduate in the department. This gives both you and your tutor a chance to get to know each other and your tutor will be able to monitor your progress. 
 
         You should meet your tutor at least three times in term 1 and twice in term 2. Keep him or her up to date with your progress and feel free to ask questions and chat about your experience at UCL. 
 
         In addition, if you are having problems, or just want to talk about your studies, then make an appointment to see your tutor at any time. 
 
         A guide to the tutorial system, which explains student and tutor expectations and entitlements in more detail can be found here.
