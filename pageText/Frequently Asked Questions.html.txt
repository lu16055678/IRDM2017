          Frequently Asked Questions
 
          The UCL Academic Manual contains all of the regulations and policies which relate to the approval, delivery, assessment and monitoring of UCL's programmes. These are very detailed and comprehensive, covering all UCL degree programmes and modules, and as a result it can be difficult to find certain information. These pages contain frequently asked questions linked to some of the most important regulations that you should be aware of, as well as information about recent changes.
 
          You should also make sure that you read your student handbook and look out for regular updates from your department for more detailed information about your specific programme. It is important to note that different regulations apply to some programmes, so you should also check Chapter 8 of the Academic Manual for regulations specific to your department or faculty. If you are unsure about anything or would like further guidance, you should contact your Personal Tutor, Departmental Office or the UCLU Rights & Advice Centre.
