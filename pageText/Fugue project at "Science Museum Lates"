         Fugue project at "Science Museum Lates"
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Science Museum Lates are adults-only, after-hours theme nights that take place in the Museum on the last Wednesday of every month. The event on 28th October celebrates computing in general and Ada Lovelace in particular. 
 
         Gordana Novakovic, UCL Computer Science's artist in residence will be joined by Nina Kov and Brigitta Zics  to showcase their work and explore the connections between computing and the arts.
