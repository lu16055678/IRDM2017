         Going Paperless: The Hidden Cost of a Receipt 
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Will Hines, BSc Computer Science student at UCL-CS, has had an article published here in the Huffington Post about an environmental IT company that Will has founded. Will is in early discussions with UCL to implement his Clinton Global Initiative University Commitment to Action, Reseed, which aims to eradicate paper receipts on the university campus and in the wider community. Reseed removes the need for paper receipts and allows users to instead access the records online. In turn, the retailer donates the money that would otherwise go towards printing costs to a tree-planting charity. 
 
         The Clinton Global Initiative gathers top students and youth organizations to create innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges. For more information, click here.
