         Google Research Award winners
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Dr Emiliano de Cristofaro, with co-Investigator Dr Christophe Dessimoz, is the recipient of a prestigious  Google Research Award. Their proposal, "Enabling Progress in Genomic Research via Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing", will now be supported with a $70,625.00 USD award.
 
         Google's Reseach Award Programme is extremely competitive and receives many strong proposals in every round. All submissions are subjected to a thorough review involving several teams of Google engineers and researchers.
 
         Congratulations to Dr Cristofaro and Dr Dessimoz.
