         Google created their PhD Fellowship Program in 2009 to recognize and support outstanding graduate students doing exceptional research in Computer Science and related disciplines.
 
         Now in its eighth year, the fellowship program has supported hundreds of future faculty, industry researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs.
 
         UCL is pleased to announce two recipients:
 
         Jamie Hayes (Machine Learning)
 
         Tim Rocktaschel (Natural Language Processing)
 
         Reflecting the continuing commitment to supporting and building relationships with the academic community, Google has announced 33 recipients in all from North America, Europe and the Middle East. Google offer its sincere congratulations to Google’s 2017 Class of Google PhD Fellows.
