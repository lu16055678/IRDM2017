             The Department of Computer Science at UCL is dedicated to increasing the number of women taking up Computer Science as a career.  There is a huge deficit in the numbers of women in STEMM subjects, the IT industry and Computer Science, and we want to be part of the growing movement to address this. Women in Computer Science is for information about departmental strategies, including networking opportunities, events, career support, and school outreach activities.

            In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed, and considerably ahead of other Institutions. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% of its research work is rated as internationally excellent.
 
            
 
           UCL researchers in Computer Science and Informatics received a ‘grade point average’ of 3.57 (out of 4) and submitted over 70 staff to be assessed in REF2014. UCL Computer Science has made seminal contributions across the full range of its core strengths and associated 11 research groups and 8 centres, including the Centre for Health Informatics & Multi-professional Education (CHIME), Biomedical Physics & Biochemical Engineering, and the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) .
