         Information Security MSc students second in Deloitte competition.
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Capture the Flag competitions are used in computer security in order to give participants experience in securing a machine as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. 
 
         This game was part of Deloitte's strategy of identifying promising talent in computer security. It lasted for 6 hours and included challenges on web and binary security, computer forensics, as well as some real world lock-picking challenges. Seven teams from UK universities participated. The UCL-CS team were drawn from the MSc Information Security programme and organised by Gianluca Stringhini. They ranked second - an excellent result given that when the students began their course in September they had no prior knowledge of information security.
