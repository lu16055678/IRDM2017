         Ingemar Cox paper wins "Sustained Impact Paper" Award
 
         
          
          

         
 
          The paper, by Ingemar J. Cox, Joe Kilian, F. Thomson Leighton, and Talal Shamoon entitled "Secure Spread Spectrum Watermarking for Multimedia" was published in the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing in December 1997. The  IEEE Signal Processing Society's Sustained Impact Paper Award honours the author(s) of a journal article of "broad interest that has had sustained impact over many years on a subject related to the Society's technical scope". 
 
         The winning paper presents an algorithm for watermarking images, and a methodology for digital watermarking that may be generalized to audio, video, and multimedia data. Such watermarks are typically used for a variety of digital rights management purposes. 
 
         The award will be presented at the ICASSP 2016 conference in Shanghai, China in March 2016.
