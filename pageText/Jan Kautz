     I am leading the Mobile Visual Computing research at NVIDIA, where my team and I work on computational photography and computer vision for mobile devices. I am also still affiliated with University College London, where I am a Professor of Visual Computing in the Department of Computer Science. I still have three doctoral students, Dan Calian, Daniyar Turmukhambetov, and Yotam Doron (sponsored by The Foundry), who will be finishing up soon.
