         Jan Kautz’s co-authored paper featured on cover of CACM. 
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Jan Kautz’s co-authored paper "Local Laplacian Filters: Edge-aware Image Processing with a Laplacian Pyramid" is featured on the cover and in the research highlights of Communications of the ACM. 
 
         The technique is outlined in a video presented by co-author Sylvain Paris and in the abstract below. 
 
         The Laplacian pyramid is ubiquitous for decomposing images into multiple scales and is widely used for image analysis. However, because it is constructed with spatially invariant Gaussian kernels, the Laplacian pyramid is widely believed to be ill-suited for representing edges, as well as for edge-aware operations such as edge-preserving smoothing and tone mapping. To tackle these tasks, a wealth of alternative techniques and representations have been proposed, for example, anisotropic diffusion, neighborhood filtering, and specialized wavelet bases. While these methods have demonstrated successful results, they come at the price of additional complexity, often accompanied by higher computational cost or the need to postprocess the generated results. In this paper, we show state-of-the-art edge-aware processing using standard Laplacian pyramids. We characterize edges with a simple threshold on pixel values that allow us to differentiate large-scale edges from small-scale details. Building upon this result, we propose a set of image filters to achieve edge-preserving smoothing, detail enhancement, tone mapping, and inverse tone mapping. The advantage of our approach is its simplicity and flexibility, relying only on simple point-wise nonlinearities and small Gaussian convolutions; no optimization or postprocessing is required. As we demonstrate, our method produces consistently high-quality results, without degrading edges or introducing halos. 
 
         The Laplacian pyramid technique was featured in one of UCL Computer Science’s Impact Stories for the 2014 REF exercise.
