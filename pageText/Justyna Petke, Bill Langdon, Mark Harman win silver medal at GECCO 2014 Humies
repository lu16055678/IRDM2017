         Justyna Petke, Bill Langdon, Mark Harman win silver medal at GECCO 2014 Humies
 
         
          
          

         
 
         CREST Research Associate Justyna Petke's work (in collaboration with Bill Langdon and Mark Harman from CREST and Wes Weimer from the University of Virginia) has won the silver medal at the GECCO 2014 Humies (for Human Competitive Results Using Genetic and Evolutionary Computation). Justyna's approach uses Genetic Improvement to automatically find new versions of the MiniSAT solver specialised and optimised for Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT). The work is described in the EuroGP 2014 paper "Using Genetic Improvement & Code Transplants to Specialise a C++ Program to a Problem Class ". 
 
         The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2014) presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics include: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, memetic algorithms, hyper heuristics, real-world applications, evolutionary machine learning, evolvable hardware, artificial life, adaptive behaviour, ant colony optimization, swarm intelligence, biological applications, evolutionary robotics, coevolution, artificial immune systems, and more.
