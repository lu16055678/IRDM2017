         LectureCast

        
 
         
         
        Recording and Publishing Lectures
 
         LectureCast is a system for recording lectures and subsequently making them available via Moodle. The system captures all material that is sent to the room's projector from any connected device (e.g PowerPoint slides from an attached laptop, hand written notes or objects held under a visualiser); audio is captured from the room's microphone system via a lapel microphone and video of the presentation area (i.e the lecturer or presenter) is captured via a small fixed position camera. 
 
         From Term 2 of 2016-17, all regular lectures that are scheduled in rooms with recording equipment will be recorded. It is at the discretion of the relevant academic and/or module leader whether or not to publish the recordings to the module's Moodle page. 
 
         Where this is made available, it is important to note that LectureCast can and does fail to record on occasion, so the availability of recordings cannot be guaranteed. 
 
        Recordings Scheduled for Term 2
 
         The table below shows which sessions have had LectureCast booked. This is also available as a Google Sheet. 
 
         
 
         The process of booking recordings is entirely manual, therefore please report any errors to David Howells.
