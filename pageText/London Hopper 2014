         London Hopper 2014
 
         
          
          

          
          

          
          

         
 
         London Hopper Colloquium 2014 took place on Thursday 22 May at the BCS Office, London. 
 
         The London Hopper Colloquia grew out of the Scottish Hopper Colloquia, and are modelled on the American Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing which is designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. These annual American meetings are held as a tribute to Admiral Grace Murray Hopper - pioneer of the computer business language COBOL - who inspired many young U.S. Naval computing students during her heyday and still continues to inspire computer scientists around the world many years after her death. 
 
         This year speakers included Dr Ivana Drobnjak, Senior Research Fellow at UCL-CS, and speaker topics covered teaching python programming, crowdsourcing and biomedical imaging. We are also delighted to announce the winners of our Research Spotlight Competiton. Congratulations to Anna Vartapetiance (University of Surrey), Iliada Eleftheriou (University of Manchester) and Ildiko Pete (University of St. Andrews).
