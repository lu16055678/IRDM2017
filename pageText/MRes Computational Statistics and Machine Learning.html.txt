              The MRes in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning prepares students for a research career in machine learning and related large-scale data analysis. 
 
              Students are expected to have a strong background in a numerate subject, ideally mathematics, statistics or computer science.  The MRes is particularly suitable for students that have some prior familiarity with data analysis and wish to engage in a substantial research project, prior to continuing a research career.  Taking the MRes will give students a deeper understanding of a research level topic and also enable the department to more fully assess the future research potential of potential PhD applicants.
 
              The MRes is taught jointly by the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Statistical Science.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data

                       The module will present the foundations of approximate inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks and Markov networks), with particular focus on models composed from conditional exponential family distributions. Both stochastic (Monte Carlo) methods and deterministic approximations will be covered. The methods will be discussed in relation to practical problems in real-world inference in Machine Learning, including problems in tracking and learning.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data.

                       The module will present the foundations of approximate inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks and Markov networks), with particular focus on models composed from conditional exponential family distributions. Both stochastic (Monte Carlo) methods and deterministic approximations will be covered. The methods will be discussed in relation to practical problems in real-world inference in Machine Learning, including problems in tracking and learning.

                       This module provides students with an in-depth introduction to statistical modelling and unsupervised learning techniques. It presents probabilistic approaches to modelling and their relation to coding theory and Bayesian statistics. A variety of latent variable models will be covered including mixture models (used for clustering), dimensionality reduction methods, time series models such as hidden Markov models which are used in speech recognition and bioinformatics, independent components analysis, hierarchical models, and nonlinear models.

                   The modules that make up a programme are either core, optional or elective, which reflects whether they must be taken or can optionally be taken. The programme’s curriculum (also called a programme diet) will prescribe in what combinations modules can be taken, any restrictions on doing so, and how much credit can and must be taken. 
 
                   Core/compulsory modules are fundamental to the programme’s curriculum and students must take these. You will be automatically allocated a place on any core modules for your programme and will not need to select these during the module selection process. There will be no timetable clashes between your programme’s core modules. 
 
                   Optional modules are strongly related to the programme and students can choose which of these they wish to take, usually from within specific groups (for example, a student may be asked to choose two optional modules from one group and three from another, etc.) Places of optional modules are strictly limited (due to spatial, resource and timetable constraints) and will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. Some optional modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Elective modules are not programme specific, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Students are usually restricted to taking one or two elective modules. There is no guarantee of being accepted onto an elective module. These modules are core or optional on other programme diets, consequently students on these programmes will be given priority. Any remaining places will then be allocated on a first come first served basis. Some elective modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Please note: timetable clashes between optional and elective modules from different specialisations are inevitable and this can result in limiting the available choices. It is the student’s responsibility to select modules that do not clash in order to meet UCLs minimum attendance requirements. Please speak to your Programme Director and/ or Programme Administrator if you have any queries. 
 
                   Non-Computer Science students should note that priority on COMP* modules will always be given to Computer Science students in the first instance.
 
                    
                  
 
                   
                   
                 
 
                  
                
 
               
 
              
 
             
 
              
              
            
 
             
           
 
          
 
           
            
             
             
              
             	The MRes is designed for people who have a first or upper second class honours BSc (or equivalent) in a numerate discipline such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering or the Physical Sciences. 
	As the course is co-taught with the Department of Statistical Sciences, we require candidates to have studied a significant mathematics and/or statistics component as part of their degree, to ensure they are able to cope with the level of Statistics involved.
	Students should also have some experience with a programming language such as Matlab.
	Appropriate industrial experience may also be considered in some cases
