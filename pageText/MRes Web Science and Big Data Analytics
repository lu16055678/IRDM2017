              Our MRes in Web Science and Big Data Analytics is highly flexible and specific, and is tailored to suit students' individual needs. It is problem-based learning and students will be encouraged to bring up their own technical problems for research, though not required. They will be able to choose their optional modules from a wide range of specialised options, including programming and analytical modules, and will research and write a dissertation based on a research project. It is a cost-effective way of addressing a specific technical problem the industry is facing. More specifically,  

              	students will start with a specific problem and choose modules based on the needed knowledge,
	then be liaised with their academic or industrial supervisor to choose a study area of mutual interest, and
	research and write a dissertation based on a 10-month research project. 


              It is intended for students who have a background in the Internet-based businesses (though not essential) and who have a specific technical question in mind for a substantial research project. We also offer the more Teaching orientated MSc Web Science and Big Data Analytics. 
 
              In our MRes Web Science and Big Data Analytics, students will gain a detailed knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and technological components of the World Wide Web and essential computational and statistical skills; they will not only learn the state of the art (Web) search and information retrieval technologies and their underlying computational and statistical methods, but also study essential large-scale data analytics to discover and extract insights, patterns, and useful knowledge from vast amounts of unstructured data produced daily by (Web) users and systems in various fields. 
 
              If you've thought about taking the skills you'll learn into the media industry, then why not get a head start and apply for this Graduate Data Scientist role, a 2 year fixed term contract that will see you complete our MRes in year 1 and year 2 working full-time for Channel 4! You'll need to apply to Channel 4, by Midnight 15th March 2017, and UCL to be considered.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data.

                   The modules that make up a programme are either core, optional or elective, which reflects whether they must be taken or can optionally be taken. The programme’s curriculum (also called a programme diet) will prescribe in what combinations modules can be taken, any restrictions on doing so, and how much credit can and must be taken. 
 
                   Core/compulsory modules are fundamental to the programme’s curriculum and students must take these. You will be automatically allocated a place on any core modules for your programme and will not need to select these during the module selection process. There will be no timetable clashes between your programme’s core modules. 
 
                   Optional modules are strongly related to the programme and students can choose which of these they wish to take, usually from within specific groups (for example, a student may be asked to choose two optional modules from one group and three from another, etc.) Places of optional modules are strictly limited (due to spatial, resource and timetable constraints) and will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. Some optional modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Elective modules are not programme specific, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Students are usually restricted to taking one or two elective modules. There is no guarantee of being accepted onto an elective module. These modules are core or optional on other programme diets, consequently students on these programmes will be given priority. Any remaining places will then be allocated on a first come first served basis. Some elective modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Please note: timetable clashes between optional and elective modules from different specialisations are inevitable and this can result in limiting the available choices. It is the student’s responsibility to select modules that do not clash in order to meet UCLs minimum attendance requirements. Please speak to your Programme Director and/ or Programme Administrator if you have any queries. 
 
                   Non-Computer Science students should note that priority on COMP* modules will always be given to Computer Science students in the first instance.
