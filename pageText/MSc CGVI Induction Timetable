         When is Induction Week?

        
 
         
         
        

        
         Induction Week this year begins on 
         Monday 26th September 
         2016 and Lectures begin the following Monday.  
         
 
        

        

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Getting to UCL

        
 
         
         
         
          
         

         
          If you are coming from abroad or have not yet visited the Main UCL Campus, the address you need to head to is Gower Street, Bloomsbury, London, WC1E 6BT.  
          

          
Detailed instructions of how to get to UCL by public transport can be found 
          on the UCL map web pages. The nearest mainline train station is 
          Euston, and the nearest underground staions are 
          Goodge Street and 
          Euston Square.  
          

          
We would recommend using the Transport for London Journey Planner below when making your travel arrangements. 
         
 
         
 
          
        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
          

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Finding the Computer Science Department 

        
 
         
         
        
         
          
           
          

         

          
           
          

          
           The Computer Science Department is located in the Malet Place Engineering Building, (
           MPEB), at the southern end of campus.  New students can access MPEB via the Engineering Front Building entrance on Torrington Place opposite Waterstones book shop.  
          

          

          
   
           
         

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Finding your way to a specific room

        
 
         
         
        

        
         Rooms at UCL are usually represented by a room code with the exception of some lecture theatres and rooms that are also named after people.  The room code consists of the building name, a floor number, a dot, then the  room number.  
         

         (E.g. MPEB 1.02 = Malet Place Engineering Building, 1st Floor, Room 2) 
         
 
         UCL is a big place and so you will be given a map as part of your induction pack to help you find your way around in the first few weeks.  
 
         Useful Tips 
 
         UCL also has a routefinder system which is very useful for finding your way to a particular place, or if you have an iPhone or iPod Touch you can download the UCL iMap app (developed by a UCL CS student), to help you navigate your way around campus.
