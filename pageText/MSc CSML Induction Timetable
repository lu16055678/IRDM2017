         All MSc CSML students will take the Statistics Foundation Course, which takes place from Monday 19th September - Friday 30th September 2016. Computer Science activities will be fitted in around the Foundation Course. Lectures begin on Monday 3rd October 2016.

          If you are coming from abroad or have not yet visited the Main UCL Campus, the address you need to head to is Gower Street, Bloomsbury, London, WC1E 6BT.  
          

          
Detailed instructions of how to get to UCL by public transport can be found 
          on the UCL map web pages. The nearest mainline train station is 
          Euston, and the nearest underground stations are 
          Goodge Street and 
          Euston Square.  
          

          
We would recommend using the 
          Transport for London Journey Planner when making your travel arrangements. 
         
 
         
 
         
 
          
        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Finding the Computer Science Department 

        
 
         
         
        
         
          
           
          

         

          
           
          

          
           The Computer Science Department is located in the Malet Place Engineering Building, (
           MPEB), at the southern end of campus.  New students can access MPEB via the Engineering Front Building entrance on the corner of Torrington Place and Malet Place (opposite Waterstones book shop).  
           
 
           More information is available at www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/getting_here/

          

          

          
 
           
         

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Finding the Department of Statistical Science

        
 
         
         
        

        
         The Department of Statistical Science is located in 1-19 Torrington Place, on the corner of Torrington Place and Tottenham Court Road. The main (security-manned) entrance is on the eastern side of the building.
        
 
        
 
        

        
          Once in the building, go straight through the double doors in front of you, turn left down a corridor along the ground floor, and go up the stairs at the far end to the first floor (or use the lifts). Here there are some more double doors, after which you're in the department. At this point:
         

         	Turn left for the departmental office, which is then the first door on the right
	Turn right for Lecture Room 102.
	Turn right for the Galton Lecture Theatre (Room 115). This is located beyond room 102, through yet another set of double doors.


         

        
 
        
 
        

        
         Please see the Department of Statistical Science webpages for more information and maps.

         Finding your way to a specific room

        
 
         
         
        

        
         Rooms at UCL are usually represented by a room code with the exception of some lecture theatres and rooms that are also named after people.  The room code consists of the building name, a floor number, a dot, then the  room number.  
         

         (E.g. MPEB 1.02 = Malet Place Engineering Building, 1st Floor, Room 2) 
         
 
         UCL is a big place and so you will be given a map when you first arrive to help you find your way around in the first few weeks.  
 
         Useful Tip 
 
         The UCL maps pages allow to search for directions to a room or building.

          Please Note: All sessions below are subject to change. Please ensure you check the below timetable regularly. You will be informed by email of any last minute changes once you have arrived.
 
          After initial registration in the Computer Science department on the Monday morning, the majority of lectures will be run by the Department of Statistical Science (indicated by [Stats] on the timetable). There are also central UCL activities indicated below which you should attend.
 
          The foundation course will consist of [Stats] sessions as indicated below.  These sessions will be based mainly on the books Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis by J A Rice and Introduction to Probability Models by S M Ross. Students should all have a copy of the former.  Most sessions will consist of an informal introductory revision lecture, individual exercises and/or group discussion of examples.
