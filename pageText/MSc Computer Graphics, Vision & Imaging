              MSc Computer Graphics, Vision & Imaging provides training in computer graphics, virtual reality, machine vision and imaging technology from world-leading experts. Research activities include geometric acquisition and 3D fabrication; real-time photo-realistic rendering; mixed and augmented reality; face recognition; content-based image-database search; video-texture modelling; depth perception in stereo vision; colour imaging for industrial inspection; and tracking for SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping). 
 
              The common theme across the programme is to understand how to make virtual reality more effective; we carry out experiments with participants to examine just what makes a difference to their sense of presence in the virtual environment. Real world scenarios like these train our students to bridge the gap between engineering, technology, creativity and design.
 
              Graduates will understand the mathematical principles underlying the development and application of new techniques in computer graphics and computer vision and will be aware of the range of algorithms and approaches available, and be able to design, develop and evaluate appropriate algorithms and methods for new problems, emerging technologies, and applications.

                       The first half of this module introduces the digital image, describes the main characteristics of monochrome digital images, how they are represented and how they differ from graphics objects. It covers basic algorithms for image manipulation, characterisation, segmentation and feature extraction in direct space. The second half of the module proceeds to a more formal treatment of image filtering with some indication of the role and implications of Fourier space, and more advanced characterisation and feature detection techniques such as edge and corner detection, together with multiresolution methods, treatment of colour images and template matching techniques.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data

                       The aim of this module is to introduce students to the main concepts and practical issues in constructing and understanding Virtual Environments, and how people respond to a VE experience. Given the background of the course teachers, the focus on the technical side will be more on the visual aspects of VEs. A central theme of the course will also be that the understanding of VEs can be best understood through the concepts of presence and shared presence.

Given the background of the course teachers, the focus on the technical side will be more on the visual aspects of VEs. A central theme of the course will also be that the understanding of VEs can be best understood through the concepts of presence and shared presence.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data.

                   The modules that make up a programme are either core, optional or elective, which reflects whether they must be taken or can optionally be taken. The programme’s curriculum (also called a programme diet) will prescribe in what combinations modules can be taken, any restrictions on doing so, and how much credit can and must be taken. 
 
                   Core/compulsory modules are fundamental to the programme’s curriculum and students must take these. You will be automatically allocated a place on any core modules for your programme and will not need to select these during the module selection process. There will be no timetable clashes between your programme’s core modules. 
 
                   Optional modules are strongly related to the programme and students can choose which of these they wish to take, usually from within specific groups (for example, a student may be asked to choose two optional modules from one group and three from another, etc.) Places of optional modules are strictly limited (due to spatial, resource and timetable constraints) and will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. Some optional modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Elective modules are not programme specific, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Students are usually restricted to taking one or two elective modules. There is no guarantee of being accepted onto an elective module. These modules are core or optional on other programme diets, consequently students on these programmes will be given priority. Any remaining places will then be allocated on a first come first served basis. Some elective modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Please note: timetable clashes between optional and elective modules from different specialisations are inevitable and this can result in limiting the available choices. It is the student’s responsibility to select modules that do not clash in order to meet UCLs minimum attendance requirements.
