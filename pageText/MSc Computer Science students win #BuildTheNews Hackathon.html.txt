         MSc Computer Science students win #BuildTheNews Hackathon
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Last weekend UCL MSc Computer Science student Pietro Passarelli took part in the #BuildTheNews Hackaton organised by The Times (https://buildthenews.wordpress.com) - and was part of the winning team. 
 
         Pietro commented on the hackathon: 
 
         "I am interested in learning more about NLP and I thought this would have been a good chance to try out a video system that would generate transcription, identify the different speakers, provide summary of main topics and keywords as well as the emotional charge of the speaker.We decided to use the upcoming elections debate  as a use case, but this could be generalised to other interview based video content. But where to start such an undertaking? 
 
         "One of the modules in the first term of the Msc Computer Science I am studying at UCL was COMPGC02, a R&D (Research and Development) module  where, working in teams and with external clients, we had to deliver a web based application that met their requirements, familiarising ourselves with technology with which we were not familiar.
 
         "Those skills proved to be extremely valuable in this hackathon, without which we would not have not been able to build a full fledged  product, or carry out the R&D research to identify and test the technology, and build a proof of concept prototype. 
 
         "Drawing on existing open source projects, libraries and APIs, we build a proof of concept prototype t grounded on solid research could "easily" be implemented in a couple of weeks worth of work, and we had a demo to showcase at the final presentation."
