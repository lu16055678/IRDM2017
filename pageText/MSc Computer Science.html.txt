             COMPGC01 Introductory Programming

            
 
             
             
            This module introduces imperative and object-oriented programming using pure Java. The module uses Java to give a grounding in key object-oriented concepts such as class design, inheritance, dynamic binding and interfaces. Material focuses on practicing object oriented programming to be better prepared for future courses including COMPGC02 Apps Design and COMPGC05 Algorithmics. This is an intensely practical module and full student engagement outside of lectures and in lab classes is critical to successful completion of the module.

            This course introduces the concepts and methods required for the design and construction of apps software systems. It aims to develop a broad understanding of the disciplines of software engineering, project management and human computer interaction (HCI). It seeks to complement this with a detailed knowledge of techniques for the analysis, design and implementation of complex software intensive systems. It aims to set these techniques in an appropriate engineering, societal and managerial context. It applies the principles of OO programming (COMPGC01) in parallel with the development of apps via learning-by-doing and problem based learning (PBL) approaches.

            The aim of this module is to 'demystify' computers, i.e. to provide a basic understanding of how computers execute programs. To show how the basic components of the computer can be built from simple electronic components such as transistors and logic gates.; and to understand why certain design decisions are made with respect to computer architectures.

            This module is an amalgam of three different aspects of systems design and construction - operating systems, compilers and databases - each having approximately equal weight. The module is a fundamental one in the programme as a whole, in the sense that it introduces material that is built on elsewhere and, consequently, much of the material will be aimed at providing a basic understanding of the role that different systems components play within real computer systems, and how they go about achieving this.

            This module covers three key aspects of computer music: representation, creativity and analysis addressed through theory and practice. It will cover sound, music as organised sound, and specific applications (e.g. music information retrieval and musicology). Students will be strongly encouraged to explore both scientific and artistic aspects of the course through programming exercises to generate sound and music in contemporary visual or textual music and arts programming languages (e.g. Python and Pure Data).

            This module covers a range of Software Engineering material, following on from that introduced in the Architecture & Hardware module. The emphasis is on the knowledge needed to be able to model, design, implement and evaluate larger software systems effectively. The content starts with development lifecycle models, such as agile development, and then continues to cover requirements specification, the Unified Modelling Language (UML), software architecture, object-oriented analysis and design, design patterns and testing. Its is an inherently practical subject; students undertake a substantial group project, working through a number of stages of the development of a larger software application.

            Prerequisites:The GC26 module is only available to students that have done Computer Science, Mathematics or Philosophy degrees that contain an existing formal logic module covering propositional and predicate logic. This module also required strong mathematical skills.
 
            This module introduces artificial intelligence and neural computing as both technical subjects and as fields of intellectual activity. The overall aims are: to present basic methods of expressing knowledge in forms suitable for holding in computing systems, together with methods for deriving consequences from that knowledge by automated reasoning; to present basic methods for learning knowledge; and to introduce neural computing as an alternative knowledge acquisition/representation paradigm, to explain its basic principles and their relationship to neurobiological models, to describe a range of neural computing techniques and their application areas.
