              Designed in conjunction with leading risk professionals, this programme aims to meet growing demand for professionals who are highly skilled in quantitative risk management. Students gain core competencies in risk analysis and have the opportunity to tailor the programme to their own interests and needs through the diversity of options available. The course is practical and data driven; a substantial part consists of a summer project usually undertaken as a placement in a major bank in the City of London.
 
              There is major interest in the Bank of England, the FSA and the Financial Services Industry to raise the level of quantitative analytics used in risk management and compliance - UCL, in collaboration with the B0E/FSA, aims set a new benchmark in this area, based on turning out risk professionals who are good scientists in the area of risk management.

                       Rehearse/survey probability theory and give a systematic introduction to stochastic processes and their applications without stressing too much the measure-theoretical aspects and other mathematical formalisms. The module is aimed at students with an undergraduate degree in engineering, physics, computer science and the like, who have a good basis in calculus and have already come into contact with aspects of probability and statistics for ad hoc applications like transport equations, laboratory data treatment, and quantum mechanics, but have not attended yet a dedicated course on stochastic processes. The course material will unfold with references to its historical development and early applications in physics/engineering the students may already heard of, ending with current-day applications in finance.

                       Between June and August students do a research project resulting in a thesis of about 10,000 words or 50 pages. This is usually undertaken within a summer placement in an industry environment organised by one of the Programme Directors, Donald Lawrence, with both an academic and an industrial supervisor. This gives students experience of conducting project work in a real-life setting and may lead to the offer of a permanent job at the end of the project; so far this happened in 20-30% of the cases.
 
                       In recent years, commercial partners have included AlgoDynamix, Algo Trading, Almanis, AXA, Banking Science, BNP Paribas, Chapelle Consulting, Citibank, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Ernst&Young, Fund Apps, Gain Capital, Intel, LCH.Clearnet, Liberis, Morgan Stanley, Mysis, Message Automation, Nomura, Oasis AWS, OptiRisk, Principal Financial Group, PricewaterhouseCooper, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Société Générale, Thomson Reuters and TSB Bank. Every year there are changes to this list and, although all students have been placed in previous years, there is no guarantee for the future, so that it cannot be excluded that, especially in the case of an economic downturn, students may need to resort to a research project internal to UCL with only an academic supervisor.

                       Rehearse/survey probability theory and give a systematic introduction to stochastic processes and their applications without stressing too much the measure-theoretical aspects and other mathematical formalisms. The module is aimed at students with an undergraduate degree in engineering, physics, computer science and the like, who have a good basis in calculus and have already come into contact with aspects of probability and statistics for ad hoc applications like transport equations, laboratory data treatment, and quantum mechanics, but have not attended yet a dedicated course on stochastic processes. The course material will unfold with references to its historical development and early applications in physics/engineering the students may already heard of, ending with current-day applications in finance.

                       Between June and August students do a research project resulting in a thesis of about 10,000 words or 50 pages. This is usually undertaken within a summer placement in an industry environment organised by one of the Programme Directors, Donald Lawrence, with both an academic and an industrial supervisor. This gives students experience of conducting project work in a real-life setting and may lead to the offer of a permanent job at the end of the project; so far this happened in 20-30% of the cases.
 
                       In recent years, commercial partners have included AlgoDynamix, Algo Trading, Almanis, AXA, Banking Science, BNP Paribas, Chapelle Consulting, Citibank, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Ernst&Young, Fund Apps, Gain Capital, Intel, LCH.Clearnet, Liberis, Morgan Stanley, Mysis, Message Automation, Nomura, Oasis AWS, OptiRisk, Principal Financial Group, PricewaterhouseCooper, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Société Générale, Thomson Reuters and TSB Bank. Every year there are changes to this list and, although all students have been placed in previous years, there is no guarantee for the future, so that it cannot be excluded that, especially in the case of an economic downturn, students may need to resort to a research project internal to UCL with only an academic supervisor.

                   The modules that make up a programme are either core, optional or elective, which reflects whether they must be taken or can optionally be taken. The programme’s curriculum (also called a programme diet) will prescribe in what combinations modules can be taken, any restrictions on doing so, and how much credit can and must be taken. 
 
                   Core/compulsory modules are fundamental to the programme’s curriculum and students must take these. You will be automatically allocated a place on any core modules for your programme and will not need to select these during the module selection process. There will be no timetable clashes between your programme’s core modules. 
 
                   Optional modules are strongly related to the programme and students can choose which of these they wish to take, usually from within specific groups (for example, a student may be asked to choose two optional modules from one group and three from another, etc.) Places of optional modules are strictly limited (due to spatial, resource and timetable constraints) and will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. Some optional modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Elective modules are not programme specific, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Students are usually restricted to taking one or two elective modules. There is no guarantee of being accepted onto an elective module. These modules are core or optional on other programme diets, consequently students on these programmes will be given priority. Any remaining places will then be allocated on a first come first served basis. Some elective modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Please note: timetable clashes between optional and elective modules from different specialisations are inevitable and this can result in limiting the available choices. It is the student’s responsibility to select modules that do not clash in order to meet UCLs minimum attendance requirements. Please speak to your Programme Director and/ or Programme Administrator if you have any queries. 
 
                   Non-Computer Science students should note that priority on COMP* modules will always be given to Computer Science students in the first instance.
 
                    
                  
 
                   
                   
                 
 
                  
                
 
               
 
              
 
             
 
              
              
            
 
             
           
 
          
 
           
            
             
             
              
             An upper-second class UK bachelor's degree (or equivalent overseas qualification) in computer science, mathematics, statistics, physics, engineering or another similar quantitative subject. Graduates in economics, finance, business administration, actuarial science or similar are considered if their transcripts show a fair number of modules in mathematics, probability, statistics and econometrics with high marks. Programming experience is a plus, but not mandatory. Relevant work experience may also be taken into account.
