                   The MSc in Machine Learning is one of the few top master programmes that is entirely dedicated to machine learning. It combines a core component and optional modules that you can tailor to your specific interests. The core component is designed to deliver the advanced knowledge and impart valuable technical skills. The optional modules offer further advanced taught components which build on the core structure.  
 
                   Students undertake modules to the value of 180 credits. Each taught module is worth 15 credits.  
 
                   The Project/Dissertation is worth 60 credits. 
 
                   Students take two core taught modules plus the individual project module. 
 
                   Plus an additional six modules from the 'optional modules' list.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data

                       The aim of this module is to introduce students to the new field of bioinformatics (computational biology) and how machine learning techniques can be employed in this area. The course is aimed at students who have no previous knowledge of biology and so the aim of Part 1 of the module is to give a basic introduction to molecular biology as a background for bioinformatics. Part 2 will concentrate on modern bioinformatics applications, particularly those which make good use of pattern recognition and machine learning methods.

                       The course is aimed at an entry level study of information retrieval and data mining techniques. It is about how to find relevant information and subsequently extract meaningful patterns out of it. While the basic theories and mathematical models of information retrieval and data mining are covered, the course is primarily focused on practical algorithms of textual document indexing, relevance ranking, web usage mining, text analytics, as well as their performance evaluations. Practical retrieval and data mining applications such as web search engines, personalisation and recommender systems, business intelligence, and fraud detection will also be covered. 
 
                       Students are expected to master both the theoretical and practical aspects of information retrieval and data mining.

                       The module provides an entry into probabilistic modeling and reasoning, primarily of discrete variable systems. Very little continuous variable calculus is required, and students more familiar with discrete mathematics should find the course digestible. The emphasis is to demonstrate the potential applications of the techniques in plausible real-world scenarios related to information retrieval and analysis. Concrete challenges include questionnaire analysis, low-density parity check error correction, and collaborative filtering of Netflix data.

                       Students will gain knowledge about robot navigation with specific focus on the use of vision as a primary sensor for mapping the environment. The module will provide students with an understanding and practical experience of recovering geometry from optical sensors and creating an environment map which a robot can use for navigation and motion planning.

                    Module Selection

                   
 
                    
                    
                   The modules that make up a programme are either core, optional or elective, which reflects whether they must be taken or can optionally be taken. The programme’s curriculum (also called a programme diet) will prescribe in what combinations modules can be taken, any restrictions on doing so, and how much credit can and must be taken. 
 
                   Core/compulsory modules are fundamental to the programme’s curriculum and students must take these. You will be automatically allocated a place on any core modules for your programme and will not need to select these during the module selection process. There will be no timetable clashes between your programme’s core modules. 
 
                   Optional modules are strongly related to the programme and students can choose which of these they wish to take, usually from within specific groups (for example, a student may be asked to choose two optional modules from one group and three from another, etc.) Places of optional modules are strictly limited (due to spatial, resource and timetable constraints) and will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. Some optional modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Elective modules are not programme specific, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Students are usually restricted to taking one or two elective modules. There is no guarantee of being accepted onto an elective module. These modules are core or optional on other programme diets, consequently students on these programmes will be given priority. Any remaining places will then be allocated on a first come first served basis. Some elective modules have pre-requisites which students will need to meet in order to be eligible for a place. 
 
                   Please note: timetable clashes between optional and elective modules from different specialisations are inevitable and this can result in limiting the available choices. It is the student’s responsibility to select modules that do not clash in order to meet UCLs minimum attendance requirements. Please speak to your Programme Director and/ or Programme Administrator if you have any queries. 
 
                   Non-Computer Science students should note that priority on COMP* modules will always be given to Computer Science students in the first instance.

             This MSc receives many more applications than it has places available and the admissions process is competitive. It may therefore take longer than the Admissions stated 6 weeks for a decision to be made and communicated. Applicants are advised to apply as early as possible due to the competition for places. Those applying for scholarship funding (particularly overseas applicants) should take note of application deadlines.
