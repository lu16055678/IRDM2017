         MSc final project presentations to industry
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Earlier this month our MSc students studying Software Systems Engineering, Financial Risk Management and Financial Systems Engineering presented their final project to guests from industry. Guests included Prof Judith Bishop (pictured with students), Head of Computer Science for Microsoft Research, and also representatives from National Rail, Leiden Genomics, Tottenham Hotspurs FC, Bank of England, BNP, Citi, JP Morgan, London Clearing House, CIBC, Deutsche Bank, Lloyds Bank, Nomura, Standard Chartered, and RBS. 
 
         UCL Computer Science is very proud to have run one of the most successful work placement programs for graduate degrees. Our students have the opportunity to enhance their relationship with City firms and key stakeholders during their degree by undertaking a summer work placement in an industry environment. The placement gives students experience of conducting projects work in a real-life setting - we congratulate students on the high quality of their project presentations.
