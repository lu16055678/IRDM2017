         MSc mid project presentations at Level39
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Last month our MSc Software Systems and MSc Financial Risk Manangement students enjoyed the wonderful view at Level39, Canary Wharf, Europe's largest financial IT accelerator space, where they presented their projects to date to an audience of leading industry professionals. 
 
         The Engineering Faculty at UCL is very proud to have run one of the most successful work placement programs as a mandatory part of specialty finance graduate degrees, and over 100 students enhanced their relationship with City firms as they networked with City regulators and key stakeholders following their presentations.
