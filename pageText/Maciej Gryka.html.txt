     I have completed the EngD programme at  University College London, working in the intersection area between computer vision, graphics and machine learning. During my research, I have developed algorithms to empower artists by making image editing software smarter and scientists by developing methods for comparing algorithms. I was supervised by Dr Gabriel Brostow.
 
     I currently lead a team of data scientists at RainforestQA.
