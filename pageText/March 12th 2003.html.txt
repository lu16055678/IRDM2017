        Agenda for the SSCC meeting 12th March 2003
 
        The meeting will be held at 1:00 pm in room 218 Chadwick Building.

        


         	Apologies for absence.
	Notification of any other business
	Approval of minutes of the meeting of 29th January 2003.
	Matters arising.
	Announcements [R Hirsch]


 
         General (in the order received, more or less) 
 

         	Student feedback on CS courses [J Saunders]
	New arrangements for Teaching Committee from May 2003 [J Saunders]
	DCNDS print quota is unreasonably small [M Ho]
	why is graduation a year after the fact and can anything be done about it? [M Ho]
	there seems to be a greater need for tutors than there are actually tutors -


i've had undergrads look for me in the dcnds lab for java help. I know UCL has 
         
a policy against hiring students to teach other students, but can we look at 
         
it/re-evaluate it for discussion with the university administration? It 
         
doesn't make sense to me [M Ho]
         	Graduation ceremony.  Why are the dates not known exactly?  Why do we have to pay for our graduation?  [G Paperin]
	Plagiarism procedures.  Some people were accused of plagiarism and it was proceeded against them


in a most disrespectful way.  Students requested to discuss how the appropriate procedures could look 
         
like [G Paperin]
         	There are several courseworks outstanding for 3rd years: 3 for


Management, 3 for Complexity, Group and Individual Project write-ups, 
         
many more for options. Several of these CWs were supposed to be set long 
         
time ago, but they were not. 
         
Students feel they should have the holidays more or less free for 
         
revision, so when are all these CWs supposed to be done? [G Paperin]
         	3C04 Complexity.


Some people have complained that the first part of the course was 
         
incomprehensive, and did not prepare people for the CW or the Exams [G Paperin]
         	Exam Regulations.


If a student has to re-take exams they have to wait a whole year and get 
         
not more then 40%. 
         
Why is it so and why can't people re-sit in autumn. There are students 
         
who lost basically 2 years for this reason [G Paperin]
         	Technology Management 3C16.  Why do we have to do it? [G Paperin]
	Chris would like to thank Barry Stein for his assistance with remote


access [M Delacour]
         Any other business
