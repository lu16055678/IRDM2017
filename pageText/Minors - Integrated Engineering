      Some of the most interesting and ground-breaking research we create does not sit comfortably in a single discipline. It exists at the interfaces between fields, drawing on expertise from a number of areas.
 
      To create a research-based education, capitalising on UCL’s strengths in these areas, all students will take a minor option as part of their degree. These are either topics from disciplines complementary to engineering, or interdisciplinary subjects based on our research strengths and taught by cross-disciplinary teams.
 
      Minors are taught across the second and third year (three modules – 45 credits in total). Students select their minors at the start of their 2nd year.
