           There are two ways to move or copy pages: 

          


           	Using icons and menus

            	Click on the page's icon in the page tree then select Page Actions and either Cut (move) or Copy from the menu. (see Fig.1);
	Next time you click on a page's icon and select Page Actions you will see two new items in the menu: Paste into and Paste After (see Fig. 2). Select one or the other depending on whether you want the copy to be a sub-page (Paste into) or to follow the current page on the same level (Paste after).



	Drag and drop

            	Click and hold the left mouse button over the name of the file you wish to move or copy.
	To copy rather than move press the control key on the keyboard.
	Drag the page to its destination. The destination can either be after an existing page (Fig. 3) or as a sub-page of an existing page (Fig. 4).
