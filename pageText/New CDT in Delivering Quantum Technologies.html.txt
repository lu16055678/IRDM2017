         New CDT in Delivering Quantum Technologies
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Computer Science is delighted to announce that a new centre for doctoral training in Delivering Quantum Technologies will be established with EPSRC funding from September 2014. 
 
         Quantum technologies involve the control and manipulation of quantum states to achieve results not possible with classical matter; they promise a transformation of measurement, communication and computation.  The highly-skilled researchers who will be the future leaders in this field must be equipped to function in a complex research and engineering landscape where quantum physics meets cryptography, complexity and information theory, devices, materials, software and hardware engineering.  UCL's Centre for Doctoral Training in Delivering Quantum Technologies brings together a team of almost forty academic experts with key players from commerce and government and a network of international partner institutes to train those research leaders.
