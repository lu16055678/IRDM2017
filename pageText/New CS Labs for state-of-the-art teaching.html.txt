         New CS Labs for state-of-the-art teaching
 
         
          
          

         
 
         With the growth of teaching in mobile technology CS has invested in new, state-of-the-art facilities for students. Two new labs and one virtual lab were designed by our very own CS Tech Support Group, which now supports all existing infrastructure and teaching. 
 
         Apps Lab 4.06, our first multi-apps platform studio laboratory, has been installed with touch screens and local device connectivity, supporting iOS, Android and Windows technologies. Meanwhile 3D Lab 1.05 is a new multi-screen lab teaching environment with multi-3D facilities; 3D printing connectivity (coming soon), stereo 3D graphics programming and 3D interaction via Kinects. The lab is also enabled for guest speakers or teaching assistants to communicate to a class over HD Skype. 
 
         In addition CS has the 300-user cluster “virtual lab” is for OS independence, where students can log in and use a remote machine with a choice of Operating Systems. CS can now boast a variety of device resources – over 50 tablets (different types), phones, Raspberry Pis, Gadgeteer boards, Arduinos, Kinects and other devices – all can be used for teaching hands-on problem based learning projects. 
 
         CS thanks everyone involved in the lab projects.
