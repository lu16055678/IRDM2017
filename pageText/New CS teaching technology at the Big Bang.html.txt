         New CS teaching technology at the Big Bang
 
         
          
          

         
 
         On 3 & 4 July UCL-CS participated in the Big Bang – the UK’s biggest young scientists & engineers fair. Staff and students showed off our robots, our new Engduino Boards, which are an innovative teaching tool designed in the Department, and the Oculus Rift, pictured, which gave children the chance to see the future of virtual reality. Over 800 secondary school children attended and they all enjoyed their computer science experience. Thanks to Prof Mark Handley, Dr Graham Roberts, Rae Harbird, Sarah Clegg, Larissa Romualdo Suzuki and Steve Marchant for their help.
