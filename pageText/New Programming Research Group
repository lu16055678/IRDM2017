         New Programming Research Group
 
         
          
          Byron Cook and Peter O'Hearn

         
 
         UCL-CS is delighted to announce that a number of academic and research staff are joining the department. This is a particularly exciting development, as these new colleagues are world leaders in their area and will form a new research group named Programming Principles, Logic and Verification. 
 
         Professor Peter O'Hearn and Professor Byron Cook have already joined from Queen Mary University of London. Peter holds a RA Eng/Microsoft Research Chair and is Head of the group. Byron is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge, as well as Professor of Computer Science. Peter and Byron are joined by four research staff engaged on their EPSRC programme grant ‘Resource Reasoning.’ These colleagues are: Dr Nikos Gorogiannis, Dr Jules Villard, Dr Carsten Fuhs and Professor Max Kanovich.
