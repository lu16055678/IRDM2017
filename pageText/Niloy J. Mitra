	Research

	 
        	 
            
              3D geometry (e.g., point clouds, triangle soups, meshes) is now easy to acquire (e.g., using Microsoft Kinect), model (e.g., using Blender), or simply download from model repositories (e.g., Turbosquid, Trimble 3D Warehouse). Such low-level data, however, makes subsequent handling and processing difficult, and hinders efficient use of model collections. Hence, I focus on developing computational frameworks to extract high-level geometric abstractions from unorganized and heterogeneous 3D data.

	Background

	 
        
          Niloy Mitra is a Professor of Geometry Processing in the Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). Niloy received his MS (2002) and PhD (Sept. 2006) in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University under the guidance of 
         Prof. Leonidas Guibas and 
         Prof. Marc Levoy, and was a postdoctoral scholar with 
         Prof. Helmut Pottmann at 
         Technical University Vienna. 
          
          Niloy's research primarily centers around algorithmic issues in shape analysis and geometry processing. He is also interested in applying the analysis findings (e.g., relations, constraints, etc.) towards next generation design tools including smart shape synthesis and fabrication-aware functional model design. 

          Niloy received the 2013 ACM Siggraph Significant New Researcher Award for "his outstanding work in discovery and use of structure and function in 3D objects" (UCL press release) and the BCS Roger Needham award (BCS press release) in 2015. He received the ERC Starting Grant on SmartGeometry in 2013.
