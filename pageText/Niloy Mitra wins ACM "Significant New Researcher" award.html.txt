         Niloy Mitra wins ACM "Significant New Researcher" award
 
         
          
          Niloy Mitra

         
 
         Niloy Mitra has become one of this year's 5 recipients of a prestigious ACM SIGGRAPH award. SIGGRAPH is a special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - the world’s first and largest computing society. SIGGRAPH has evolved to become "an international community of researchers, artists, developers, filmmakers, scientists, and business professionals who share an interest in computer graphics and interactive techniques". Niloy has been chosen as this year's "Significant New Researcher".

         SIGRAPH's citation for Niloy's award begins "ACM SIGGRAPH is proud to recognize Niloy Mitra with the 2013 Significant New Researcher Award for his innovative and inﬂuential contributions to geometric analysis of shapes, 3D modeling techniques and computational design tools.  
 
         The hallmark of Niloy’s research has been the development of mathematical and computational foundations to discover and use structure and function of 3D objects.  
 
         He has successfully applied this philosophy to develop computational frameworks for smart and intuitive acquisition, manipulation, and synthesis of fabrication and function-aware 3D geometry."
