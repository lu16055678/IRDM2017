This is an example of the more general issue of avoiding having just one lecture in a day.
	Printing and Printer Quotas:
- status of the line printer,
- extra quota for projects, quotas are too low,
- cost of extra pages (5p per page) is to high, should be 1-2p per page,

- and counting double side printing as 2 pages.
