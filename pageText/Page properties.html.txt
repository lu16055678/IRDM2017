          The form above appears for all new pages. For existing pages it can be produced by:

          	Selecting Edit from the menu that appears when you click the icon next to the page in the page tree or
	Clicking on the Edit page properties icon ( at the top of the TYPO3 screen) - when a page is selected.


          For "ordinary" web pages most of the form can be ignored - but note the following:
 
          General tab (Fig. 2)

          


           	Usually you will want a Standard page. Occasionally other options might be useful, for example:

            	Shortcut to another page - this allows a page to appear in more than one position in the page tree.
	Link to external URL - this puts a page in the page tree, hence in the automatically generated menus, but the actual page content is held elsewhere - for example on the main UCL server.



	Page title - this is the one field that must be filled in. It identifies the page and will be the title displayed by the browser when the page is viewed.
	Alternative Navigation title. If the Page title is inconveniently long then a briefer Navigation title may be provided for use in menus.



          
          Access tab (Fig 3)

          	Hiding a page can be useful for new pages that you are still working on - you will be able to see the page and edit it, no on else will. Check Page Disable to hide a page. (You may find this set by default when a new page is created. There is more on this below.)
	Hiding a page in the menu allows a page to be displayed but excludes it from automatically generated menus Check In Menus Hide to achieve this.


          Appearance tab (Fig 4)

          	You can choose between the several page layouts provided by the UCL-CS templates.


          Now click the save and quit icon () to save the information and quit the form.
