         Peter Bentley and Christos Sakellariou in this week's New Scientist
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Peter Bentley, Honorary Reader at UCL-CS, and EngD Research Student Christos Sakellariou are featured in this week's New Scientist. 
 
         The computer that never crashes is about a revolutionary new computer based on the apparent chaos of nature can reprogram itself if it finds a fault. Dubbed a "systemic" computer, the self-repairing machine now operating at UCL could keep mission-critical systems working.
