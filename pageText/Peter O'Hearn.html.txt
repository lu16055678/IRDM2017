 I am a Professor of Computer Science at University College London. I'm also an Engineering Director at Facebook, where I work on developing and deploying techniques from program verification and static analysis. 
     My research has been in the areas of programming languages and logic. I have worked on theoretical topics (e.g., on new logics and category-theoretic models...) and on practical tools for program verification and analysis (e.g., Smallfoot, Space Invader, Abductor, Infer). I like to think that fundamental theory, tool development and application can and even should play off one another via mutual feedback in computer science research, in a way reminiscent of the experimental method.
