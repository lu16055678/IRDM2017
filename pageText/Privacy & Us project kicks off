         Privacy & Us project kicks off
 
         
          
          

         
 
         This week, the Privacy & Us project officially started with a kick-off meeting in Munich, Germany.
 
         Funded by the EU H2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie program after a highly selective review process (6% acceptance rate), this Innovative Training Network (ITN) will train 13 early stage researchers (ESRs) to be able to reason, design, and develop innovative solutions to questions related to the protection of citizens’ privacy, considering the multidisciplinary and intersectoral aspects of the issue. 
 
         ESRs will be trained to face both current and future challenges in the area of privacy and usability, spending a minimum of six months in secondment to another partner organization, and participating in several training and development activities.
 
         Three studentships will be host at UCL, working under the supervision of Dr Emiliano De Cristofaro, Prof. Angela Sasse, Prof. Ann Blandford, and Dr. Steven Murdoch.
