         Project paper wins prize at Eurographics 2014
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Two UCL researchers, Melinos Averkiou and Niloy J. Mitra have co-authored a paper which won second prize at the 35th Eurographics conference in Strasbourg. The paper focuses on the problem of identifying recurring parts from a graphical model. The team's key observation was that "while a direct comparison of part geometry can be ambiguous, part arrangements, being higher level structures, remain consistent, and hence can be used to discover latent commonalities among semantically related shapes".
