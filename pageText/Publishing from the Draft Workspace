         Publishing your draft

        
 
         
         
        
          
           
          It is possible to arrange matters within TYPO3 so that a formal workflow is enforced; the completed draft has first to be submitted to one or more reviewers who must approve it before sending it on the the designated publisher. This is not used in the CS-Draft set-up. Instead, you as editor must take the responsibility of ensuring your draft is as it should be. You then go ahead and publish it yourself. At that point the current LIVE version will disappear and will be replaced by your draft. If you want to revert to the previous version you can still do so - see the section on rolling back.

          The simplest way to publish is as follows: 

          	Click the view icon () which will give you the Preview screen then select the List View tab. This gives the screen in Fig.1. This shows a single page in the draft workspace (sometimes there may be more);
	Check the box next to the page;
	Open the menu at the bottom of the screen and click on Publish to LIVE.


          There is much more to workspaces. This document gives more details.
