         UCL Computer Science and the BCS Academy will be presenting the 11th. London Hopper Colloquium on Wednesday, 20 May 2015 at the BCS headquarters in London. This 1-day event is free and will feature women speakers talking about their research, a spotlight competition open to postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and lots of opportunities to network with other new researchers in computing. 
 
         Confirmed speakers and titles of their talks are: 
 
         · Dr. Tracy Hall, Brunel University: Understanding, Finding and Eliminating Faults in Software 
 
         · Professor Carron Shankland, University of Stirling: Adventures in Evolving Process Algebra 
 
         · Anna Vartapetiance, University of Surrey: Personal data as part of “all-inclusive” holiday packages 
 
         · Sara Mitchell, IBM: Why does business care about cloud computing? 
 
         We are also pleased to announce that Dr. Cordelia Schmid from INRIA, France, will be presenting the 5th Karen Spärck Jones Lecture, an evening event honouring women in computing research, that will follow the London Hopper at the BCS Headquarters. Dr. Schmid is the Research Director and Head of the LEAR (LEArning and Recognition in Vision) Project Team.
 
          Both of these events are free.
