         Robotics and Autonomous Systems work showcased
 
         
          
          

         
 
         As part of a recent showcase briefing and networking event for Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) in Horizon 2020, scientists from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UCL and MIT gave a presentation on multi-scale robotic teleoperation to the Rt Hon Greg Clark, Minister for Universities and Science. 
 
         Prof Mandayam Srinivasan, co-founder of the field of haptics who leads the work at MIT and UCL TouchLabs, started with an overview of teleoperation and haptics at multiple scales from industrial engineering to human scale applications, including robot assisted and remote surgery. The minister was also able to try a hands-on demonstration of micromanipulation with haptic (force) feedback developed by Dr Vijay Pawar and Prof Srinivasan.
