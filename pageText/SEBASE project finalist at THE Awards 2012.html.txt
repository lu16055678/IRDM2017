         SEBASE project finalist at THE Awards 2012
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The Times Higher Education Awards 2012 shortlisted the SEBASE project (forerunner to the DAASE project) as a finalist for the award of "Research Project of the Year". The three SEBASE project principal investigators, Professors Harman, Clark and Yao attended the award ceremony in London on 29th November 2012. The award went to Queen Mary, University of London for their excellent project on Home Testing for Cervical Cancer. Despite not winning, the SEBASE team were delighted to be shortlisted. Well done to the QMUL team on winning the award!
