         Scholarships for Master’s students
 
         
          
          

         
 
         To help gifted engineering students deal with this year's financial turbulence, UCL Engineering is offering a select number of scholarships worth £ 2 k to those with a record of excellent academic achievement. These Excellence Scholarships will be awarded to UK & EU Master's candidates across all nine departments within the Faculty, at the discretion of the Vice-Dean (Education). 
 
         Applications will be received until July 2012, and decisions will be made based on pure merit. We do this in the UCL spirit of providing a world-class education to all, regardless of their background. Please see our Admissions Pages for information about our Master’s programmes and how to apply.
