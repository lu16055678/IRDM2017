         Second Year Systems Engineering Project Launch
 
         
          
          

         
 
         September saw the launch of the 2013-14 Systems Engineering projects for second year Computer Science undergraduates. A total of twenty-three groups will be working on an exciting range of projects, supported by sponsors including Microsoft, the NHS, the BBC, the Metropolitan Police and a number of UCL departments. 
 
         Each project will see an initial idea turned into a proof of concept prototype, which is then developed into a production design ready for delivery to the project sponsor. 
 
         The highlight of the launch event was an entertaining and stimulating talk by Prof. Bill Buxton, Principal Researcher from Microsoft, Redmond USA, who spoke about ubiquitous computing and the future of embedded devices. Prof. Buxton is also supporting several of the Systems Engineering projects.
