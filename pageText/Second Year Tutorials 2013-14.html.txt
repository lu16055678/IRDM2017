         Your tutor's role is to monitor your progress and be someone to talk to about your work or any problems you are having. You are required to meet  your tutor twice per term (in terms 1 and 2) to report on how things are going. Usually this will be near the start and end of each term. You can also make an appointment to see your tutor at any time you feel the need.  
 
         Our policy is that you normally have the same tutor throughout your time as an undergraduate student in the department. If your tutor becomes unavailable you will be assigned to a new tutor. 
 
         A guide to the tutorial system, which explains student and tutor expectations and entitlements in more detail can be found here.
