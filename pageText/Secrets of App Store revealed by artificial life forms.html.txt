         Secrets of App Store revealed by artificial life forms 
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Dr Soo Ling Lim (UCL Statistical Science) and Dr Peter Bentley (UCL Computer Science) have modelled Apple's App Store marketplace as an ecosystem, revealing what makes it thrive.  
 
         Their work has been reported as this week's lead technology story in New Scientist: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428605.300-secrets-of-app-store-revealed-by-artificial-life-forms.html 
 
         Lim and Bentley will present their work at the GECCO conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in July 2012.
