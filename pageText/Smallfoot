  Smallfoot

   
  

  
 Smallfoot is an automatic verification tool that checks separation logic specifications of sequential and concurrent programs that manipulate recursive dynamically-allocated (linked) data structures. 
  

  
 Smallfoot 0.1 is distributed as a source 
  tarball (
  MD5 checksum) under the 
  QPL. 
  Objective Caml (version 3.07 or later) is needed to compile it. There are no additional source dependencies. Additionally, the distribution includes precompiled MacOS X PPC and Linux x86 executables. Here is a 
  precompiled Win32 executable. 
  

  
 For further information, and a description of the input language, see the 
  README.

  SmallfootRG, which extends Smallfoot with Vafeiadis and Parkinson's combination of rely/guarantee and separation logic.
