         SnapIT
 
         
          
          

         
 
         SnapIT is a camera triggering app developed by UCL MSc. Computer Science students Jack Armstrong, Abhishek Ambastha and Matt Arneil, for their projects associated with an app development module. For this course, students team up with industry, in this case, Triggertrap, to deliver innovative and forward thinking software solutions. 
 
         SnapIT allows Windows phone users to trigger their DSLR camera with their Windows device, after connecting them with the Triggertrap dongle, available here:

         SnapIT provides a number of functions that can enhance your photography. Use Time Lapse to set the number of photos to take and the time intervals between photographs, Time Warp, to set the number of photos to take and vary the time interval between them, or Sound Mode, to trigger the camera with a noise like clapping your hands, or shouting.
 
         Jack, Abhishek and Matt are pictured with Rich Harley, Head of Product at Triggertrap. A promo vid can be found on our Students & Industry webpage here:
