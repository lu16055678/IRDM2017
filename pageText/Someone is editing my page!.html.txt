          TYPO3 does not lock a page in order to prevent two people from trying to edit it simultaneously. However, it does warn you that another user is trying to edit the same page as you. 

          	You should always look for the warning icon which appears in the page tree (Fig. 1). 
	You may also see a warning above the page properties form (Fig. 2).


          In either case you should contact the other user before proceeding.
