        Currently there is no spell checker installed in the TYPO3 Rich Text Editor (RTE). Some browsers (e.g. Firefox, Chrome) have their own spell checkers. If this is enabled you will see dotted red lines under misspelled words. In principle they can also correct misspellings. Unfortunately this feature is masked by the TYPO3 RTEs use of the right mouse button.
