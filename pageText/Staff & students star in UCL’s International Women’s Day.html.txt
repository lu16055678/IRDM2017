         Staff & students star in UCL’s International Women’s Day
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The exhibition ‘Women at UCL: Presence and Absence’ was created as part of UCL's International Women's Day events to celebrate and recognise women at UCL who inspire those they work with. There was a fantastic response to the call for nominations, with over 200 submissions, which shows the real impact UCL women have on their colleagues. 
 
         The exhibition profiled women from across the UCL community. A call went out asking staff and students to nominate a woman at UCL who had influenced them – either by inspiring or encouraging, or helping them to think differently about their work or study. A panel, made up of representatives from UCL’s equality groups, had the challenging but enjoyable task of selecting these 24 inspirational women from a pool of excellent nominees. As the response was so overwhelming, the panel considered it important to recognise everyone who had been nominated, so this booklet has been created profiling every nominee.
 
         The department is delighted that in doing so UCL has formally recognised Mara Balestini, Prof Nadia Berthouze, Dr Sue Black, Prof Licia Capra, Dr Anna Cox,  Diana Lee,  Prof Angela Sasse, and Dr Alexandra Silva as women who inspire those they work with.
