        The Staff-Student Consultative Committee (SSCC)
 
         The Departmental Staff-Student Consultative Committee exists to provide a forum for discussion between the staff and students of the Computer Science Department.

	Frequently Asked Questions


        The UCL Union runs the Student Academic Representatives programme (StARs) to support and train student representatives. Visit the website here for more information. 
 
        Each undergraduate year and each MSc programme has one or two student representatives. To nominate yourself to be a representative download this form and submit it to the CS Departmental Tutor (Graham Roberts). Where there are more nominations than places, an election will be held to select the representatives. 
 
        The selection of representatives for MSc programmes takes place during early October. The selection of representatives for undergraduate and research programmes takes place in February. This page gives the details.
