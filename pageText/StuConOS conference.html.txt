         StuConOS conference 
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Welcome to StuConOS
 
         The StuConOS conference is aimed at current undergraduate and master students. The conference will give students a chance to submit their work and to have this reviewed by a programme committee of experts. We interpret the word "optimisation" in its very broad sense: anything that improves (in any way) software or the process of making it. It will give students an initial taste of research work and a chance to publish and discuss their ideas with experts. The programme committee will review the submissions and decide on those to be accepted and the prizes to be awarded. All authors will receive feedback on their work and those accepted for the conference will be published as UCL Research Notes and presented (by one of the authors) at the conference. 
 
         There will be prizes for the best three papers submitted in the form of a gold, silver and bronze medal which will be accompanied by a gift of £500, £300 and £200 respectively. 
 
         Please note: submissions with at least one author who is not a UCL student are permitted provided that the work is primarily that of a currently registered UCL undergraduate or masters student, who is also an author of the submission and who will be presenting the work if accepted and who will also be receiving the prize money if awarded.
