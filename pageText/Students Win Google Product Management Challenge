         Students Win Google Product Management Challenge
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Henry Scott-Green and Dominik Krejcik, 2nd and 3rd year Computer Science students at UCL, have won first place in a recent Google Associate Product Manager Challenge. 
 
         The challenge brief was to design a windscreen user interface system for the Google X self-driving car project. This was presented to Google product managers and simulated Venture Capitalists at Google's headquarters in Victoria, London. The winning design, as chosen by the panel of judges, was selected because of it's safety-oriented approach, combating the public-perception issue faced by the self-driving car industry. 
 
         The windscreen system informs users of hazards and other motorists it is tracking, giving an insight into the decision engine of the car, intended to increase passenger confidence in the vehicle.
