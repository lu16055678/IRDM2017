         Students invited to design games
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The CHI+MED project and UCL Interaction Centre invite teams of students to design a game that will be made freely available on errordiary.org. Prizes will be awarded at the final showcase, including £1000 for first place, £500 for runner up and £500 for the people’s choice. Get started by registering here for our kick-off event, taking place on Feb 1st 2014 at UCL. 
 
         We’ll have a series of mini-talks by domain experts who will present perspectives that relate to key aspects of our research including: human error, blame culture and working within healthcare. We’ll also have an exciting session on designing persuasive games. At the Q&A session, you can fire your questions at our panel of experts. After lunch, we’ll get people started on developing ideas with a workshop on novel game mechanics. This will be your chance to dive in, find teammates and explore ideas for the competition.
