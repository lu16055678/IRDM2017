         Students' charity app wins first prize
 
         
          
          

         
 
         First year students at UCL-CS, with the direction of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), have launched a charityware app developed for the Reading Quest charity. 
 
         The learning game app "Numbugs" won first prize in an RBS collaboration competition and was launched on the Google Play store. Several first year undergraduates studying Object Oriented Programming worked with recent finance graduates at RBS to develop a full app charity support plan. This included work packages for each student developer, professional design assets with artists and business modelling input and direction from the graduates at RBS. 
 
         Alastair Brown, CIO at RBS for International Banking, acted as the mentor to the RBS graduates and UCL students. The app was selected by Stephen Hester, RBS Group Chief Executive.
