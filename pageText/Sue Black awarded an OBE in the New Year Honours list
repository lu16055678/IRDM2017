         Sue Black awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours list
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Sue Black, Honorary Senior Research Associate in the Department, has been awarded an OBE for services to technology. Sue's award is in acknowledgement of her tireless campaign to save Bletchley Park, which she started in 2008. With support from Twitter luminaries such as Stephen Fry and technology companies including Google, Bletchley Park has now been saved.  
 
         The Bletchley Park Trust congratulated Dr Black on the award and said: "Thousands of people, including Sue Black, contributed to the saving of Bletchley Park over more than two decades. Without their collective work, the site would have been lost forever."
 
         Sue Black told the BBC that the award was a "wonderful surprise", and she describes the Bletchley Park campaign as "my proudest achievement."Her recently published book, Saving Bletchley Park: How #socialmedia saved the home of the WWII codebreakers, tells this story and is available now.
 
         Sue has also been an inspiration to women wanting to get involved in the technology world. 
 
         Having left school at 16, she only began her university education at the age of 25 as a single mother with three children, and went on to found the UK's first online network for women in tech. The department congratulates Sue on her achievement.
