          The page context menu
 
          Minor changes have been made to the menu which appears when you click an icon next to a page (see Fig. 1).

          	Hide/unhide has become Enable/Disable;
	Page Actions include creating new pages, copying, moving and deleting pages.


          Note that the view icon () has become the show icon ().

          It is now possible to move and copy pages using drag and drop. See this page for more details.
