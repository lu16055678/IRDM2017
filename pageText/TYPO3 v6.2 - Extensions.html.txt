         Extensions

        
 
         
         
        
          
           
          In addition to the core software, TYPO3 comes with a large number of optional extensions. We use a number of these. As far as can be judged, most seem to work as before. However, if you encounter problems please email g.knight@cs.ucl.ac.uk. 
 
          A couple are worth mentioning: 
 
          Responsible
 
          This extension produced the date and ownership of a page - usually right at the bottom. The extension no longer works. However, the same function is now provided via a different route. Please contact g.knight@cs.ucl.ac.uk if this is not working satisfactorily. 
 
          Mouseoverimages
 
          This implemented various visual effects when the mouse cursor entered an image. It does not work with TYPO3 v6.2 and there is no obvious replacement. An alternative has been implemented which allows images to be lightened or darkened when the mouse cursor crosses them.
