         Files

        
 
         
         
        
          
           
          It is now possible to store "metadata" with a file including a title and a description of its contents. When a list of files is displayed using the filelinks content element the title will replace the filename. 
 
          Figure 1 shows the view of files in a folder. Ticking "Extended view" (1) shows all available icons. Clicking the pencil (2) allows the metadata to be edited.

          Files can now be added or replaced in a folder by drag and drop. Simply drag a file from your PC onto the folder screen and a grey area will appear (Fig 2). Drop the file there and it will be uploaded.
