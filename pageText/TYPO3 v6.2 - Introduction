         TYPO3 6.2 - Introduction

        
 
         
         
        Although there are many internal changes, as far as users/editors are concerned, TYPO3 v6.2 behaves much like the version we have used previously - v4.5. The general look and feel, the icons etc. remain much the same. Some things are easier - for example you can drag and drop files from your PC when uploading them.
