         Term closes with 4th annual robot race
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Term closed with our first year undergraduate students taking part in our annual robot race. The event, now in its fourth year, is the culmination of the Robotics Programming module. This takes hands-on project work and programming skills already learned to encourage students to solve problems, including devising strategies for structuring code, dividing problems up into pieces that can be solved independently, then integrating the pieces into a whole to solve a larger problem. 
 
         As the race days approach, students are still unaware of the track layout, on the ray days they must battle the clocks to program their robots to understand and navigate the twists and turns of the course. We are grateful to Morgan Stanley's ongoing support and trophies were awarded in their name to our winners.
 
         Congratulations to our 1st place team - Jamie Law & Daniel Gavrilov. In second place were Kwok Cheng & Alex Xu, and in third place were Bagus Maulana & Vika Christy. We would like to thank our Teaching Assistants and Technical Support Group for their time on the race days.
