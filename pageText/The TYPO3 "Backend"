          When you log in to TYPO3 you see a screen like the one below:
 
           
         

         
          
           
            
             
            

           

          

         

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        There are three main areas (labeled 1, 2 & 3 above):

        	The left-hand menu allows you to switch between various TYPO3 modules. As shown, the "Page" module is in use. This is the most common module to use when editing pages. (Note that the precise list of modules available may differ between users).
	The second column shows the "page tree" (as it always does when the page module is in use). This shows all the pages available on the website - or at any rate the pages in the part of the website you are entitled to edit. The pages are organised in a tree - rather like the files and folders on a PC). Currently the page entitled "Exercise 1" is selected. The full path to this page can be read from the tree. It is:

Help ›› TYPO3 ›› Editing Existing Content 

This path will be shown in the "breadcrumb trail" when the page is viewed.
	The third column shows the editing panel - see below.

 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        The editing panel
 
        The panel has three column labeled "LEFT", "NORMAL" and "RIGHT". The CS website uses these columns as follows:

        	
          LEFT
         
	
          This is used for adding custom menu items to the left-hand column of a web page. Frequently this will be left blank in which case the left-hand column will just show the automatically generated menu. (see 
          Automatic Menus)
         
	
          NORMAL
         
	
          This is where the main page content is placed. See below for how to add and edit content.
         
	
          RIGHT
         
	
          CS pages do not have a right-hand column so in the great majority of cases this column can be ignored. (It is used for a few pages which have specialised layout requirements but this can be ignored for now).
