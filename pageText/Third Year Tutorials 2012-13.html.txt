        Tutors
 
        Your tutor will continue to be the same person as in the first and second years, unless there have been any staff changes. You should continue to meet at least twice per term during terms 1 and 2. BSc students will also have a project supervisor for their final year project (who does not have to be the same person as your tutor!).
