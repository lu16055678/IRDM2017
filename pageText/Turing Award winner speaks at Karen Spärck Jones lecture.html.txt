         Turing Award winner speaks at Karen Spärck Jones lecture
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The Karen Spärck Jones lecture is an annual event that honours women in computing research. 
 
         The lecture series builds on the activities to celebrate, inform and support women engaged in computing. These include the annual London Hopper, providing networking opportunities for early career researchers, and the Lovelace Colloquium, for women undergraduates in computing and related subjects. 
 
         Professor Barbara Liskov presented the 3rd Karen Spärck Jones Lecture, honouring women in computing research. This event was sponsorsed from IBM and BCS and was held at the BCS London office, and Head of Department Prof John Shawe-Taylor delivered the vote of thanks. 
 
         The slides and video of Barbara's talk entitled The Power of Abstraction can be found here.
