[back] 	 Fire alarm testing
 
 The alarm systems are maintained on a quarterly basis with emergency callout by Fisk Fire Protection Ltd; though in addition, to meet our legal obligations the systems have to be tested on a weekly basis.

 This test will normally mean that the alarm will sound for no longer than 5-10 seconds each week. For the Malet Place Engineering Building, the alarm test is usually on Thursday morning between 8am and 10am. Please note that we are linked to the Roberts Building (aka "New" Engineering Building) so you may here more than one alarm sound.
 
 AN ALARM SOUNDING FOR ANY LONGER SHOULD BE TREATED AS A NORMAL FIRE ALARM ACTIVATION AND YOU SHOULD EVACUATE THE BUILDING IMMEDIATELY.
