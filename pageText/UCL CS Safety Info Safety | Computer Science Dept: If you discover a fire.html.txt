[back] 	 If you discover a fire
 
 There are heat and smoke detectors throughout the building, but if you discover a fire yourself, raise the alarm by any of the following methods and then get out immediately:

 Alarm Point: 
       	
	Fire Point - press to raise alarm 

 
These are usually located near the Fire Exits at the front and back of the building. They set off the alarm by pushing the safety glass against the button (You don't need to use force).

 The Fire Action Notice signs are nearby and will show you the Building/Zone number and the Assembly Point. You will also see these in other areas of the College and they will show the details for that specific area. 

 Telephone:

 UCL operates a Security Control Room which is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to deal with emergencies. Contact them on the internal phones by dialling 222.

 State the name of the building and the fire zone (if you know it). They will contact the Fire Brigade and direct them to the right part of the campus.
 
 If this isn't possible, call 999 from a mobile phone, or 9999 from internal phones.
 
 As shown on the Fire Action Notice the Computer Science Department is based in Malet Place Engineering Building, which is Fire Zone 350. 
 
 Do not wait for assistance, you should then evacuate the building as normal. Tell a Fire Marshall (in the yellow jackets) where the fire was located.
