[back]	 Lab chair adjustment
 The office chairs in the CS student labs are adjustable in 3 ways to enable to to position yourself correctly for DSE work.
 
      	Seat height
	 Back rake (angle)
	 Back height

 
      
 
 Seat height is adjustable using the front lever on the right hand side.
 Lifting this lever will release the mechanism and make the seat drop. 
 If you half stand up and pull the lever towards you the seat will rise. 
 When you release the lever, the seat will stay in that height.
 
      
 
 Back rake (angle) is adjustable using the rear lever on the right hand side. 
 Lifting this lever will release the mechanism and if you put any weight on the back rest, it will drop (so be careful!).
 Adjust the back angle, then push the lever back down to lock into place.
 
      
 
 Back height is adjustable using the knob on the left hand side.
 Rotate the knob forward to release the mechanism.
 Adjust the back height so that the curve of your back is well supported.
 Rotate the knob backward to lock in place.
 You may need to adjust the angle again if it now feels too tight.
 If a chair seems faulty, please report it to the Helpdesk or email request
