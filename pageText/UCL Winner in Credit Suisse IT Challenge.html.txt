         UCL Winner in Credit Suisse IT Challenge
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Reece Doyle, MEng Computer Science student, is a winner in Credit Suisse's IT Challenge. 
 
         Participants are encouraged to put their analytical thinking skills to the test by answering two quizzes and two open-ended questions. Reece was awarded second prize, Amazon vouchers worth £250 and dinner with senior Credit Suisse representatives in London. 
 
         The Department is delighted for Reece. We support student competitions and are pleased to enjoy strong links with Credit Suisse - a global leader in finance and technology.
