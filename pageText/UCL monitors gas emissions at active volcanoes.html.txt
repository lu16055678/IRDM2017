         UCL monitors gas emissions at active volcanoes
 
         
          
          

         
 
         A UCL team of Dr Christopher Kilburn (UCL Earth Sciences), Prof Steve Hailes (UCL Computer Science) and Lara Smale (PhD UCL Earth Sciences), in partnership with the INGV-Vesuvius Observatory, conducted successful tests of prototype, low-cost sensors for monitoring gas emissions at active volcanoes.
 
         Together they deployed the sensors at the Campi Flegrei volcano, which is currently in unrest on the western edge of Naples in southern Italy. The tests confirmed that the recording capability of the sensors is comparable with that of conventional sensors that are several times more expensive. 
 
         Highlighting their potential impact, Dr Kilburn said: “The sensors will facilitate independent monitoring of active volcanoes by dedicated volcano observatories around the world. Furthermore, due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, they have the potential to be deployed in Developing Nations, where most of the world’s active volcanoes are found and where funding has thus far been insufficient to permit continuous monitoring with conventional instruments.”
 
         The UCL team presented their findings at the 'Cities on Volcanoes' conference in Puerto Varas, Chile, in November 2016 and are in the process of raising funds for full development and testing of the sensors.
