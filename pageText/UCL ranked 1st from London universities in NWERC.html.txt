         UCL ranked 1st from London universities in NWERC
 
         
          
          

         
 
         This year UCL has prepared and sent 3 teams to the NWERC (Northwestern Europe Regional Contest) part of ACM programming competition which was held in Bath on 20th November 2016.
 
         During the contest, the teams consisting of three students had 11 algorithmic problems to solve. They must submit solutions as programs in C, C++, Java or Python (although it is not guaranteed every problem is solvable in Python). Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified and can submit another program.
 
         The winner is the team which correctly solves most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved.
 
         The team consisting of Andrei Margeloiu, Georgi Georgiev and Pranav Murugappan ranked 1st from London universities and 11th in the overall scoreboard, winning a medal.
 
         The scoreboard is available here - http://nwerc2016-scoreboard.bath.ac.uk/static/scoreboard/static.html
