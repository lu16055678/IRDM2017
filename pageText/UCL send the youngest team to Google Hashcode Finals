         UCL send the youngest team to Google Hashcode Finals
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Google Hashcode is the largest team-based algorithmic competition organised by Google. This year, the participants coming from all over the world, had to optimise the placement of WI-FI routers in a building in order to get the most coverage with minimal costs.
 
         This year, a UCL team consisting of first-year students Andrei Margeloiu, Wojciech Golaszewski and Cosmin Vladianu (pictured), made up thee youngest team to participate in the 2017 World Finals organised in Paris.
 
         The scores were very tight and they got 540 million points while the winning team got 548 million points (just 1.5% difference). That ranked them 36th globally.
 
         The competition was amazing and Andrei confesses:
 
         "Participating in the World Finals is a totally different experience than normal competitions. You are surrounded by the best people and can see just looking at them the passion they have and how much time they have devoted in this field."
