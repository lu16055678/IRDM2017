         UCL success at GECCO Human Competitive Awards (HUMIES) 2016
 
         
          
          

         
 
         UCL's Centre for Research on Evolution, Search and Testing (CREST) was recognised at the GECCO Human Competitive Awards (HUMIES) 2016 in Denver, Colorado. 
 
         The Department would like to congratulate: 
 
         Alex Marginean who received the Gold medal and a $5000 prize for his work on Automated Transplantation, with Earl Barr, Justyna Petke, Yue Jia and Mark Harman; 
 
         & 
 
         Federica Sarro who received the Bronze medal and a $2000 prize for her work on Multi Objective Effort Estimation with Alessio Petrezziello and Mark Harman. 
 
         The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation.
 
         CREST is widely known for its work on Empirical Software Engineering, Evolutionary Computation, Code Provenance, Quantified Information Flow, Security, Software Testing, Program Slicing and Search Based Software Engineering. 
 
         This work is funded by the EPSRC DAASE Programme Grant on Dynamic Adaptive Automated Software Engineering and UCL Department of Computer Science.
 
         The Centre also hosts a series of monthly open workshops.
