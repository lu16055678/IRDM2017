         UCL undergraduates feature in "hackathon".
 
         
          
          

         
 
         According to Wikipedia a "hackathon" is "an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development ... collaborate intensively on software projects. 
 
         This was certainly the case for three UCL undergraduates who took part in the "Disrupt Europe 2014" hackathon in London. The three, Davit Buniatyan, Zahra Traboulsi and Muhammad Dwi Abi Rafdi​ worked overnight to produce their "Newsly" app. The app employs machine learning APIs to create a news-reader interface which makes it simple for users to express their preferences. The system subsequently reflects these preferences in the articles it displays for them. 
 
         Their work was featured in the online TechCrunch magazine which promoted the hackathon.
