         UCL winners at HackNotts
 
         
          
          

         
 
         UCL Computer Science students returned from HackNotts as winners following a 24 hour hackathon held during 29th-30th November. Hosted by the University of Nottingham, over 200 students teamed up to learn about tech and create cool stuff. 
 
         Team Bello was comprised of Second Year UCL Computer Science Undergraduates Rohan Kopparapu, Kevin Kwan, Pranan Murugappan and Jazib Mahboob. Together they worked on an SMS based blogging system using Twilio and Google's Material Design project, Polymer. 
 
         The hackathon was an exciting and stimulating experience, and resulted in Team Bello winning prizes for the best UX (user experience) design awarded by Capital One.
