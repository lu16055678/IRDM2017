         UCL's Angela Sasse featured in Nature
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Angela Sasse, Professor of Human-Centred Security and member of UCL's Information Security Research Group, appears in the latest issue of Nature. 
 
         In How to hack the hackers: The human side of cybercrime, Angela addresses ransomware - an extortion scheme in which hackers encrypt the data on a user's computer, then demand money for the digital key to unlock them. Victims get detailed, easy-to-follow instructions for the payment process, and how to use the key. If they run into technical difficulties, there are 24/7 call centres. 
 
         This gives way to Angela's belief that the attackers are so far ahead of the defenders; receiving greater support for their activities than one might expect from their own Internet service providers. 
 
         Angela's work reflects the need for more psychologists, economists and human-factors people to fight back and change people's habits to beat the hackers.
