         UCL's Team Chime are Atos IT Challenge 2015 finalists
 
         
          
          

          
          

         
 
         We were delighted that Team Chime from UCL Computer Science finished 3rd at the ATOS IT Challenge 2015 in Paris, with a design for the doorbell of the future, which lets you answer your door from your phone anywhere, anytime. 
 
         The theme for this year’s Atos IT Challenge was Connected Living. Participating students were asked to uncover the opportunities enabled by the Third Digital Revolution  which will see 25 billion objects connected to the Internet by 2018. Knowing that the benefit of connecting people, devices, processes, location and other data sources will be measured in how new services improve our quality of life, the judging panel were looking for benefits to both end users and potential business partners.
 
         The judges were particularly impressed by the fact that the Team Chime has secured interest from one UK delivery company, which sees potential for the app to reduce the cost of re-deliveries. Our congratulations go to team members Stephen Traynor, Pejhmon Kamaie, Owen Newburn, Tarek Allam and Sam Partridge.
