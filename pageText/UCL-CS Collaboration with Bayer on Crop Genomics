         UCL-CS Collaboration with Bayer on Crop Genomics
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The Dessimoz Lab (GEE & CS) and Bayer CropScience NV (Ghent, Belgium) have initiated a collaboration on the development of new methods and resources to better characterise evolutionary and functional relationships between model plant genomes and agronomically-relevant crop genomes. The collaboration involves a jointly funded PhD student (Ivana Piližota, second from right) and a postdoctoral associate (Dr. Diana Coman Schmid, middle) funded by Bayer CropScience NV and the EU FP7 Plant Fellows programme. The kickoff meeting took place on Wednesday 6 Nov at UCL.
