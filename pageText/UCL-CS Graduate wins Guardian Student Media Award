         UCL-CS Graduate wins Guardian Student Media Award
 
         
          
          

         
 
         The Guardian Student Media Awards have been running for 36 years. They aim to "seek out the best student writers, designers, broadcasters, editors, and photographers". The "Student media startup of the year" category is "designed to reward the most innovative and impressive experiments in media launched by students within the last three years." 
 
         Pietro Passarelli, who graduated with a distinction from UCL's MSc Computer Science programme last year, developed a web tool which allows journalists to search for quotes from a video through an automatically generated transcript and then embed the quote, with the accompanying video excerpt, in an online article.
