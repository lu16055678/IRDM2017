         UCL-CS students meet JP Morgan Challenge
 
         
          
          The UCL students from the winning team

         
 
         Last month (16 - 18 November), J.P. Morgan hosted their first ever "Code for Good" Challenge in their London office. The challenge was an opportunity for top tech talent from UK universities to come into the firm and, through their team coding skills, use technology to address a social challenge for one of JPM's three partner charities: Centrepoint, WaterAid or The Nature Conservancy.  
 
         21 students attended from UCL - the most from any university - and impressed JPM with the standard of their work. The participants were organised into teams. The top 6 teams (2 representing each charity) were selected as finalists and presented again to the judges and all their fellow Coding Challenge attendees. The winning team, Urban Green, included five UCL-CS students: Thiam Shui Tan, Lynnette Ng, Wei Shan Lim, Kelvin Khoo and Shi Qi Ng. Wei Shan Lim is student from Carnegie Mellon University studying at UCL under the "Junior Year Abroad" scheme.
