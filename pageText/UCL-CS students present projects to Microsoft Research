         UCL-CS students present projects to Microsoft Research
 
         
          
          

         
 
         UCL Engineering undergraduate students got the unique opportunity to present their work-in-progress projects to the Directors of Microsoft Research.  With real-world clients and support from Microsoft, projects include developing technologies with Windows 8 Embedded (just received from Microsoft HQ in Redmond), Gadgeteer, Azure and Kinect with Robotics. Use case scenarios include for surgery training, hospitals and care homes, networked vehicles, new interactions in gaming and education, remote home automation and more. A demo of semi-transparent display technology was also shown by our students!
