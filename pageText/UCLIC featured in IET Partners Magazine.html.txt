         UCLIC featured in IET Partners Magazine
 
         
          
          

         
 
         UCL's Interaction Centre (UCLIC) is featured in the IET's latest Partner Magazine. 
 
         Digital Coding: the next big thing beyond coding looks at the new approach to learning, which brings together disparate aspects of computer science, cognition, design and everyday life to provoke curiosity, deep learning and creativity. 
 
          It was developed by an interdisciplinary team from UCL Computer Science at UCLIC, led by Prof Yvonne Rogers together with Dr Nic Marquardt, Dr Venus Shum, Dr Rose Johnson and Susan Lechelt (pictured). The team has produced ed an extensive, tangible computing toolkit called Magic Cubes; special building blocks that encourage collaborative exploration through a range of exciting and sometimes mysterious making and programing activities.
 
         For example, one minute someone can be using it to construct a cube, the next making a pattern of LEDs light up while shaking the cube, then watching an interconnected set of cubes placed in a room light up like a Mexican wave.
