         UCLIC: most successful UK HCI group at CHI2015
 
         
          
          

         
 
          Authors from UCL will have a great presence at CHI 2015, the premier conference in Human-Computer Interaction, which takes place in Seoul, Korea, April 18 - 23 2015.
 
          Check out this list, which makes UCL Interaction Centre the most successful UK HCI group at #chi2015!
 
          We are delighted that four of our papers received Best of CHI Honorable Mentions. 
 
         For over 30 years, the CHI conference  has attracted the world’s leading researchers and practitioners in the field of HCI from businesses and universities to share ground-breaking research and innovations related to how humans interact with digital technologies. 
 
          The theme for CHI 2015 is "Crossings": crossing borders, crossing boundaries, crossing disciplines, crossing people and technology, crossing past and future, crossing physical and digital, crossing art and science, … crossing you and me.
