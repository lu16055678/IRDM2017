         Getting to UCL

        
 
         
         
         
          
         

         
          If you are coming from abroad or have not yet visited the main UCL Campus, the address you need to head to is Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT.  UCL is in an area of London known as Bloomsbury.
          

          
Detailed instructions about reaching UCL by public transport are on the 
          UCL map web pages. The nearest mainline train station is 
          Euston, and the nearest underground stations are 
          Goodge Street and 
          Euston Square.  You can also download the 
          UCLGO! App to access maps and other useful UCL University and Union information on the go.
          

          
The Transport for London Journey Planner (link below) is useful for making travel arrangements. 
         
 
         
 
          
        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
          

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Finding the Computer Science Department 

        
 
         
         
        
         
          
           
          

         

          
           
          

          
           The Department of Computer Science is based in the Malet Place Engineering Building, (
           MPEB), at the southern end of campus. Instructions for reaching us are at 
           www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/about_us/getting_here/
          

          

          
 
           
         

        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         Finding your way to a specific room

        
 
         
         
        
         
          
           
          

         

          
           
          

          
           Rooms at UCL are usually represented by a room code with the exception of some lecture theatres and rooms that are also named after people.  The room code consists of the building name, a floor number, a dot, then the room number.  For example MPEB 1.02 = Malet Place Engineering Building, 1st Floor, Room 2. 
           
 
           UCL is a big place and so you will be given a map as part of your induction pack to help you find your way around in the first few weeks.  
 
           Useful Tips 
 
           UCL also has a routefinder system which is very useful for finding your way to a particular place, or if you have an iPhone or iPod Touch you can download the UCL iMap app (developed by a UCL CS student), to help you navigate your way around campus.

        Please make sure you arrive on time to avoid missing important information.   
 
        For some activities you will be split into groups, divided by family names. 
 
        
 
         
       
 
        
        
        
         
        
         What if I Miss an Induction Event?

        
 
         
         
        

        
         If you are unable to attend any of the induction events please let your 
         Programme Administrator know so they can tell you important information that may have been missed.
