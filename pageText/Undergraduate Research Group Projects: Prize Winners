         Undergraduate Research Group Projects: Prize Winners
 
         
          
          

         
 
         On Wednesday 26th March, 3rd year UCL-CS MEng students presented the outcome of their Research Group Projects during a mini-conference event that marked the end of their research module. Five projects in five different research areas have taken place this year: from computational social science to human computer interaction, from information retrieval to natural language processing, to software engineering. 
 
         A panel of academics was in charge of nominating the Best Research Group Project of the year. Competition was tough and in the end two projects were equally ranked first: "Task Identification Using Search Engine Query Logs" (group members: Bartosz W Adamczyk, Li Q Khoo, H H Horace Li, Haolin Zou; supervisor: Emine Yelmaz) and "How Culture Shapes Q&A Programmers' Forums - a Case Study with Stack Overflow" (group members: Tina Fallahi, Samuel J Gaus, H W Leong, Rasheed Wihaib; supervisor: Licia Capra). 
 
         All students are to be congratulated.
