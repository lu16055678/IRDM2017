       Undergraduate Syllabus Index 2015-2016

       This database contains 2015-16 versions of the syllabuses. For current versions please see here.

        
         
         
          
         1. To pass a computer science undergraduate module at First, Intermediate or Advanced Level (i.e. modules for 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students), you must:

         	Obtain an overall pass mark of 40% for all components combined;
	Obtain a minimum mark of 30% in each component worth ≥ 30% of the module as a whole.


         2. To pass a computer science undergraduate module at Master's Level (i.e. modules for 4th year students), you must:

         	Obtain an overall pass mark of 50% for all components combined;
	Obtain a minimum mark of 40% in each component worth ≥ 30% of the module as a whole.


         3. Be 'complete' for the coursework component (if there is one). For computer science modules, this means that you must have completed at least 35% of the coursework. Other departments might require a higher percentage, so please check with the departments concerned.
