       Undergraduate Syllabus Index 2016-2017

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         1. To pass a computer science undergraduate module at First, Intermediate or Advanced Level (i.e. modules for 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students), you must:

         	Obtain an overall pass mark of 40% for all components combined;
	Obtain a minimum mark of 30% in each component worth ≥ 30% of the module as a whole.


         2. To pass a computer science undergraduate module at Master's Level (i.e. modules for 4th year students), you must:

         	Obtain an overall pass mark of 50% for all components combined;
	Obtain a minimum mark of 40% in each component worth ≥ 30% of the module as a whole.


         3. Be 'complete' for the coursework component (if there is one). For computer science modules, this means that you must have completed at least 35% of the coursework. Other departments might require a higher percentage, so please check with the departments concerned.
