             Programme Structure
 
             This research Masters programme focuses on technology and applications of virtual reality, computer graphics, imaging and computer vision.  Students conduct research alongside world leading researchers specialising in cutting-edge research into virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D modelling, visualisation, interfaces, gaming and social. They enjoy UCL’s multidisciplinary tradition, sharing ideas and resources from across UCL’s Faculty of Engineering Sciences and beyond.
 
             Students will learn how to analyse, engineer and evaluate a broad range of virtual reality and augmented reality systems. Students will learn how to analyse requirements for interfaces, such as type of system, role of application tasks and perceptual requirements. Students will learn how to develop for advanced immersive systems. Students will also learn about how to validate and evaluate systems.

             Why the VEIV Centre?
 
             
             

             The VEIV Centre 
 
             The Virtual Reality MRes is run by the Virtual Environments, Interaction and Visualisation (VEIV) Centre at UCL, which for the past 15 years has been a world leader in computational capture, rendering and simulation for a diverse range of applications.
 
             UCL has world-class virtual reality facilities. These include the full range of consumer AR & VR equipment, a variety of motion capture systems, a large CAVE projection room system and a variety of haptic robots. It has been a pioneer in VR research for over 20 years.
 
             Our students conduct their research alongside world leading researchers who specialise in cutting-edge research areas such as sensors, detectors, tracking, 3D, modelling and visualisation, and interfaces, gaming and social. They enjoy UCL’s multidisciplinary tradition and share ideas and resources from across UCL’s Faculty of Engineering Sciences and beyond.
 
             Our alumni have secured careers as research developers, programme management consultants, environmental design analysts, hardware design engineers and strategy managers, because they have an excellent understanding of the current questions facing industry and the skills and experience to market innovative solutions. The VEIV Centre is based in UCL’s Department of Computer Science: a global research leader, ranked by the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 evaluation as the best computer science department in the UK.
 
              
 
             Research Areas
 
             Research undertaken at the VEIV Centre can be divided into three broad areas.
 
             Show: 3D, modelling and visualisation
 
             Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies reveal to us a life-like picture of real and imagined worlds. To make effective systems, we need to be able to scan, model, understand and reproduce the real world. The VEIV has significant expertise in a broad range of related technologies such as computational photography, geometry processing, medical imaging, CAD & GIS systems and rendering.
 
             Interact: Interfaces, gaming and social
 
             Virtual reality and augmented reality will soon become a part of our everyday computer usage. The technologies are also inherently social: either collaborating within the virtual world or through mixed-reality interface. The VEIV Centre has played a pivotal role in developing the latest multimedia and research on virtual environments, interactive interfaces and cutting-edge real-time gaming technologies.
 
             Sense: Sensors, detectors and tracking
 
             Technology advances allow us to continuously monitor our environment, to amass and test data, and to use this data to produce a meaningful picture of our complex world. The VEIV Centre has contributed towards advances in object tracking, image recognition and the latest sensor and detector technologies.

             Programme Fees
 
             This programme is only available as a full-time option: part-time study is not possible. 
 
             Full-time fees;
 
             	UK/EU: £11,800
	Overseas: £25,130

 
             Postgraduate Loans
 
             UK Government-backed postgraduate loans worth up to £10,280 are now available, to help Masters students cover their tuition fees and living expenses
 
             These non-means-tested, repayable postgraduate student loans are similar to those that are offered to undergraduate students, and are a major new development for higher education in England.
