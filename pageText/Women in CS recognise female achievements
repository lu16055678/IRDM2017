            On the 19th October the CS Ladies group met in a local tea shop  to celebrate the successes of female academics in CS this year. With four promotions and Professor Angela Sasse's election as Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, there was a lot to celebrate. 

            	


             
 
            Ladies tea time is a monthly event for all female CS academics, that started last year as part of the CS Department's Athena Swan activities.
