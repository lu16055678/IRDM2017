       Year 2 MEng Mathematical Computation

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         Students on the 2nd year of the Mathematical Computation programme take 7 compulsory modules, each with a credit value of 15, and one elective module with a credit value of 15. Details of the syllabus for MATH* modules are maintained by the Mathematics Department. 
 
         Suggested options are listed below. You may take no more than one module (15 credits) at basic/introductory level during your programme. 
 
         Details of option and elective choices outside CS are maintained by other academic departments. If in doubt, check with the relevant department for availability, pre-requisites, and timetabling details. 
 
         Note: UK students who do not have a GCSE grade C or equivalent in a foreign language (other than Ancient Greek, Biblical Hebrew or Latin) on admission to UCL will be required to take their optional module in a modern foreign language.
