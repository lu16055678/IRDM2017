         Year 3 BSc Computer Science IEP

        
 
         
         
        Students on the 3rd year of the BSc Computer Science (IEP) from 2016/17 carry out an individual project (credit value = 30) or Interdisciplinary Research Project (credit calue = 30), 2 core modules (each with a credit value of 15), 2 follow-on Engineering Minor Options and 2 further CS options from the range of CS Year 3 modules to make up a total of 120 credits  
 
        Details of Minor Option modules outside CS are maintained by other academic departments. If in doubt, check with the relevant department for availability, prerequisites, and timetabling details.
