       Year 3 MEng Mathematical Computation

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         Students on the third year of the Mathematical Computation programme take 3 compulsory modules (all in term 1), each with a credit value of 15. The remaining 5 modules are to be selected from the list below. There is also the possibility of selecting one elective module worth 15 credits, the agreement of the Programme Director must be sought. Please see http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/teaching_learning/undergrad_inf/curriculum/year_3_meng_math_computation/

          Optional and Elective Modules

         
 
          
          
         There are many potential option choices in the third year, but this does mean that there will be combinations of courses that are unavailable due to timetable clashes. 
 
         *You will need to have the agreement of both the Maths Department Tutor and your Programme Director in order to take MATH3202 or MATH3704.
