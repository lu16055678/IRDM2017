       Year 4 MEng Computer Science

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         
          Year 4 MEng Computer Science & MEng Computer Science (International Programme)

         
 
          
          
         Students on the 4th year of the MEng Computer Science and MEng Computer Science International Programme carry out an individual project (credit value = 30), and 6 option modules (to make a total of 120 credits for the whole year).  You are advised to choose your options from the range of CS year 4 (i.e. Master's level) modules. You may select a non-CS module but this is subject to the approval of the Departmental Tutor, and the department which offers the module you are interested in. All option modules must be at Master's level. 
 
         Details of option choices outside CS are maintained by other academic departments. Please check with the relevant department for availability, pre-requisites, and timetabling details.

          M-level Optional Modules

         
 
          
          
         There is a wide range of Master's level option choices, and this reflects the research strengths in the department. 
 
         We have grouped the choices below so they broadly match the Specialist MSc degree programmes to which they belong.  This will hopefully help you to navigate the timetabling a little more easily (clashes within these groupings are minimal).  You can of course make choices across a range of groupings, but because of timetabling constraints not all combinations will be possible.
