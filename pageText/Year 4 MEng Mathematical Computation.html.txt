       Year 4 MEng Mathematical Computation

       This database contains the 2016-17 versions of syllabuses. Syllabuses from the 2015-16 session are available here.

       

       Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s).

        
         
         
          
         Students on the 4th year of the MEng Mathematical Computation Programme carry out an individual project (credit value = 30), and 6 option modules (to make a total credit value of 120 for the whole year). Students should normally choose their options or electives from the range of CS or Maths year 4 (i.e. Master's level) modules. One module from elsewhere in UCL (at Master's level) may be selected subject to the Programme Director's approval. All option and elective modules must be at Master's level. 
 
         Details of option choices outside CS are maintained by other academic departments. Please check with the relevant department for availability, pre-requisites, and timetabling details.

          M-level Optional Modules

         
 
          
          
         There is a wide range of Master's level option choices, and this reflects the research strengths in the department. 
 
         We have grouped the choices below so they broadly match the Specialist MSc degree programmes to which they belong.  This will hopefully help you to navigate the timetabling a little more easily (clashes within these groupings are minimal).  You can of course make choices across a range of groupings, but because of timetabling constraints not all combinations will be possible.
