    Video Inpainting
 
   
 
    
     
   
 
    
     MSc CGVI project supervised by Dr. Gabriel Brostow. A user-guided approach to video inpainting - the task of repairing portions of, or removing objects from, a video sequence.
 
    This system uses a state-of-the-art video segmentation technique by Grundmann et al. combined with structure-from-motion data and allows a user to quickly remove unwanted foreground elements with a small amount of interaction in a small number of frames.
 
    Implemented in C++/QT and MATLAB.

    I go to James Lloyd's evening portrait class at the Prince's Drawing School. A few of us occasionally share work here.
