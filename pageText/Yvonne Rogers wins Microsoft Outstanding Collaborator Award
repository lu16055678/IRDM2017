         Yvonne Rogers, Professor of Interaction Design and Director of UCL Interaction Centre, has been announced as a Microsoft Research Outstanding Collaborator 2016. In its 25th Anniversary Year Microsoft is highlighting 32 great academics worldwide who have collaborated in a variety of ways with researchers in their labs over the years. These contributions have had an outstanding impact on the direction, visibility and value of Microsoft's research and products. 
 
          Since its founding in 1991, Microsoft Research has grown to be a worldwide symbol of excellence in computer science. Our over 1,000 scientists, engineers, and designers produce technologies that change the lives of people every day through their innovative software, systems, and designs. 
 
         Microsoft is proud of our accomplishments, but in reality they are all founded on a model of open collaboration with academia.
