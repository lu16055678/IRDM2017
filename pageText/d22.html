  Objectives 

  This course aims to further develop your understanding of the concepts and methods required for the construction of large software intensive systems. It aims to develop a broad understanding of the discipline of software engineering. 
It seeks to complement a familiarity with analysis and design with a knowledge of the full range of techniques and processes associated with the development of complex software intensive systems. It aims to set these in an appropriate engineering and management context. 

  Skills 

  After completing the course you will be able to: 

  	 understand the issues affecting the organisation, planning and control of software-based systems development;
	 be able to establish and run a small software intensive system development project;
	 read and understand the professional and technical literature on software engineering.
