        UCL Mechanical Engineering is a research-led department that is a dynamic and vibrant place to study and carry out research, whether you are a prospective student, researcher or industrial collaborator. 

 
        Mechanical Engineering as a distinct discipline in the UK started right here at UCL in 1847. More recently, in the latest national research review (REF2014) over 90% of our department's research was judged "world leading" or "internationally excellent".

 
        On this site you can learn more about our programmes of study, our people and the research we conduct.

 
        UCL Mechanical Engingeering is one of 11 departments of UCL Engineering, one of ten faculties of London's Global University UCL.
