         €1.3m ERC Starting Grant for Dr Jens Groth
 
         
          
          

         
 
         Dr Jens Groth has been awarded a highly competitive €1.3m ERC Starting Grant. The grant will support a research group dedicated to the development of efficient zero-knowledge proofs. 

Zero-knowledge proofs make it possible to demonstrate that a given statement is true without revealing any other information besides the truth of the statement. They are used in security applications where participants give zero-knowledge proofs that they are acting honestly and correctly; this ensures cheaters cannot deviate from the protocol they are supposed to follow.
